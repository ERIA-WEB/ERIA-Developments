<p><strong>Jakarta, 26 December 2022:&nbsp;</strong>The Institute for Global Environment Strategies (IGES), a non-profit policy research institute in Japan, launched a project to test the effectiveness of behavioural insights in reducing the use and waste of single-use plastics in cities and communities. The project is funded by and conducted in close collaboration with the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).</p>
<p>The project plans to develop practical knowledge on applying behavioural insights in concrete settings and provide an easy-to-use toolkit for local governments, businesses, and schools.</p>
<p>In line with this goal, ERIA and IGES called for implementing partners from Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. In collaboration with IGES, selected partners will plan, implement, and monitor pilot projects to test the effectiveness of interventions informed by behavioural insights to reduce single-use plastic waste.</p>
<p>From 2 to 31 November 2022, the project received 44 proposals. An evaluation committee composed of six experts from IGES and ERIA reviewed all the applications based on a clear description of the context (settings and target), behavioural insights to be tested, and monitoring methods.</p>
<p>Following a rigorous screening process, the following were selected: Chula Unisearch, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand; Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Indonesia; Southern Institute of Ecology, Viet Nam; and Task Force on Environmental Sustainability, University of the Philippines Diliman, the Philippines.</p>
<p>The four partners will work with IGES to develop detailed implementation and monitoring plans from January to August 2023. The lessons learnt from the four pilot projects will then be summarised into a guidance toolkit that can be used to apply behavioural insights to reduce plastic consumption in Asian cities and communities. The toolkit is scheduled to be launched in late 2023.</p>

Politicians have so far turned a blind eye.</p><p>Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak and the coup in Myanmar in February 2021, the un-demarcated 2,401-kilormetre common border had been manageable and relatively calm. However, in the coming months, the frontier could become the country&rsquo;s biggest time bomb. All it needs is a small spark which is unfortunately outside of Bangkok&rsquo;s control.</p><p>A recent assessment by the Thai security agencies of the country&rsquo;s border situation with Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Myanmar concluded that the Thai-Myanmar side is the most vulnerable. Other border areas do not face the imme&shy;diate disruption of the border admin&shy;istration&rsquo;s capacity as there is no possible influx of asylum seekers in the near team which could cause a dramatic humanitarian crisis.</p><p>For instance, the border with Cambodia used to be the country&rsquo;s No.1 concern due to illegal migrant workers when bilateral ties were at a low ebb. Now thanks to Cambodia&rsquo;s stability and its excel&shy;lent relationship with Thailand, the government-to-government deal on migrant workers has proved useful.

Politicians have so far turned a blind eye.
Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak and the coup in Myanmar in February 2021, the un-demarcated 2,401-kilormetre common border had been manageable and relatively calm. However, in the coming months, the frontier could become the country&rsquo;s biggest time bomb. All it needs is a small spark which is unfortunately outside of Bangkok&rsquo;s control.
A recent assessment by the Thai security agencies of the country&rsquo;s border situation with Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Myanmar concluded that the Thai-Myanmar side is the most vulnerable. Other border areas do not face the imme&shy;diate disruption of the border admin&shy;istration&rsquo;s capacity as there is no possible influx of asylum seekers in the near team which could cause a dramatic humanitarian crisis.
For instance, the border with Cambodia used to be the country&rsquo;s No.1 concern due to illegal migrant workers when bilateral ties were at a low ebb. Now thanks to Cambodia&rsquo;s stability and its excel&shy;lent relationship with Thailand, the government-to-government deal on migrant workers has proved useful. Before the outbreak, nearly 50,000 Cambodians were working in the country legally.
However, in the case of the Thai- Myanmar border, although there is a similar arrangement for migrant workers, it does not work very well. The sheer number of people wanting to cross the border is 20-fold that on the Cambodian side, in particular over the past 23 months. Two interrelated issues can be discerned here: the ever-increasing number of illegal border crossings through natural channels with a myriad of well-con&shy;nected human smuggling rings, and insufficient preparedness on the Thai side to handle the sudden massive influx of villagers across the border in the coming dry season. Currently, only six border checkpoints are in operation.
More than the Thai authorities would like to admit, the constant influx of new arrivals has already caused a strain on the provincial health system, which still has to fight the Covid-19 pandemic as well as other contagious diseases such as Malaria. At the moment, at least 250,000-300,000 Myanmar people from all parts of the country are congregating along the Thai- Myanmar border, which is mostly under the control of ethnic armed groups.
For the time being, most of them are eking out a meagre living, waiting for their turn and fortune to cross the border for jobs and life security. For the well-to-do, they can easily find places in cities of their choice across the border.
With the new Asean chairman, Indonesia, taking over next month, anxiety and uncertainty are increasing among Myanmar people residing along the border. Given the long-standing history of Indonesia&rsquo;s tough stance on Myanmar, there could be shifts in Asean&rsquo;s strategies towards the military junta, officially known as the State Administrative Council. It there are further push-backs by the junta against the border areas, these groups of people will likely panic and attempt to cross the border no matter what the risk is.

Under these new circumstances, Thailand needs to tighten intra-agency coordination and cooperation and forge proactive policies against the above headwinds otherwise there will be a &ldquo;human security&rdquo; catastrophe on western border.

The new catalyst would be increased support of the National Unity Government, Ethnic Armed Organizations, People&rsquo;s Defense Force as well as. Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH). To date, no Western countries have enacted such law for such a purpose.
It is well known that the US Congress often involves itself in the internal development of other countries by coming up with legislation and sanctions to punish groups or governments, which in their view, are not democratic and oppress their people.
In the case of Myanmar, it is very clear that the US wanted to help the Myanmar people to obtain democracy so they authorized the provision of so-called &ldquo;non-lethal&rdquo; assistance to the groups fighting the military regime in Nay Pyi Taw, namely the NUG, EAOs and PDF.
From a historical perspective, especially the wars in Southeast Asia such &ldquo;non-lethal&rdquo; aid can at times be very lethal. The line is somewhat blurred. It could involve training and providing assistance to improve the recipients&rsquo; capacity to mitigate the defensive capacity of hostile forces.
If there is no substantive progress in coming months, the situation in Myanmar could spin out of control and gradually transformed into a mini proxy war. The State Administration Council (SAC), the official name of military junta, plans to hold an election in August.
If the SAC proceeds the poll as planned, the next eight months could be bloody because there is still no political dialogue and no consensus from all stakeholders what kind of election they would agree and have. Without any prior consultation among conflicting partners, the election and its outcome would be a sham.
In addition, the incoming chair, Indonesia, has a different idea of the ways and means to deal with Myanmar. Fresh from the success of the chair of G20, Indonesia and President Widodo Joko, who has been hailed as a global leader, would want to stay focus on Indonesia&rsquo;s priority on multiple crisis including food, energy, health as well as digital transition.
&nbsp;
Therefore, the Myanmar crisis would not be high on the Jakarta&rsquo;s agenda as it was in the past two Asean chairmanships.
What kind of role is Indonesia going to take up? After the coup, Brunei Darussalam and the chair&rsquo;s special envoy, Erwan Yusof adopted a low and benign profile, pursuing the ASEAN 5-point consensus (5PC) with a small progress.
When the next chair, Cambodia, took over, both Prime Minister Hun Sen and his team were in an overdrive mode. Believing his personal experience and good intention will help usher back Myanmar to the ASEAN embrace and help ending the quagmire, Hun Sen personally led the process.
In the end, the military junta did not buy in the Cambodia chair&rsquo;s appeals and proposals. Incoming ASEAN chair, Indonesia, will be more circumspect but resolute in pressing for the implementation of the 5PC.
As the world&rsquo;s third largest democracy, Indonesia wants to contribute to democratization in Myanmar. As the new chair can refocus the 5PC from the current trajectory to inclusive political dialogue. At the moment, it seems all the stakeholders are still not in the mood for negotiation as they are thinking they can win this war.
The latest US Congress decision might embolden the opposition to intensify fighting to gain more assistance. Indonesia will present the ASEAN agenda under its tutelage at the foreign ministerial retreat later next month.
With a common border of 2,401 kilometres with Myanmar, Thailand has the highest stakes if anything goes wrong.
With the continued fighting inside Myanmar, more and more people are moving away from the Northern region towards the South near the Thai border. Indeed, the Thai-Myanmar border is swollen and could burst at any time.
For the past two years, Thailand has been using quiet diplomacy, not silent diplomacy as political pundits have described, to ensure the country&rsquo;s engagement with all concerned parties both in Nay Pyi Taw and along the border which are under the control of ethnic armed organizations.
Since the coup in 2021, Thailand has wanted to make sure that all the key players in the conflict would be able to hold dialogue. So far, that has not been possible given the current hostile situation inside Myanmar.
To jump start an informal long-term process to build trust and confidence among the countries that have a direct or indirect interest in Myanmar&rsquo;s quagmire, Thailand has invited its colleagues from Asean to join a consultative dialogue.
The open-ended meeting which took place last Thursday, was not an Asean meeting. Thailand hopes that in the future, countries which share borders with Myanmar would be invited to exchange views.
All in all, the Myanmar quagmire has entered a new phase, which will become more intense with greater outside support for resistance groups. Thailand is ratcheting up its diplomacy both openly and discreetly in search of an exit strategy&nbsp; because the region has more to lose if Myanmar&rsquo;s crisis continues.

At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his country is ready for talks. Yet, the two leaders are not talking to each other. Their messages about a possible peace dialogue came through others.</p>
<p>Both sides have said time and time again that they are ready to negotiate, but on their own terms. Ukraine has made it clear that the Russian troops must have withdrawn from all Ukrainian territory. Russia insists that a ceasefire can be achieved only if Kyiv meets its demands. These positions will be very difficult to meet.</p>
<p>What is clear is that winter is here and civilians and soldiers in Ukraine are suffering. Already, more than 8 million people in various parts of Ukraine have no electricity or water and are also lacking in other daily necessities. Therefore, this winter will be a harsh one. It is the time for peace talks. Each side has to yield to create a conducive atmosphere for talks. Neither has.</p>
<p>Then, out of the blue, Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov issued an ultimatum, saying that either Kyiv meets Moscow&rsquo;s demands or the issue would be decided by the army. What he meant was that there would be more missiles targeting key structures inside Ukraine. Lavrov&rsquo;s words were contrary to those of his boss. So, is Russia sending mixed signals to the world or simply staging a PR stunt?</p>
<p>Of late, Ukraine has been bolstered by additional aid from the US. President Joe Biden has given Patriot Missiles to Ukraine, to protect itself from incoming missiles. The US has, so far, supported Ukraine to the tune of some US$55 billion, which is considered a huge sum of money given the current state of the US economy.</p>
<p>Ways must be found to get both leaders&rsquo; intentions to converge and materialise in ways that could suspend the war for a while. The US would be a key player, as well the other members of NATO. Otherwise, both sides will continue to suffer and the war would intensify. It could even worsen and possibly end up as a nuclear war.</p>
<p>When the Republicans take over the lower House next month, there could be some change in the US policy towards Ukraine. After more than 300 days of fighting, there is no decisive military victory by either side, only a human calamity.</p>

At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his country is ready for talks. Yet, the two leaders are not talking to each other. Their messages about a possible peace dialogue came through others.
Both sides have said time and time again that they are ready to negotiate, but on their own terms. Ukraine has made it clear that the Russian troops must have withdrawn from all Ukrainian territory. Russia insists that a ceasefire can be achieved only if Kyiv meets its demands. These positions will be very difficult to meet.
What is clear is that winter is here and civilians and soldiers in Ukraine are suffering. Already, more than 8 million people in various parts of Ukraine have no electricity or water and are also lacking in other daily necessities. Therefore, this winter will be a harsh one. It is the time for peace talks. Each side has to yield to create a conducive atmosphere for talks. Neither has.
Then, out of the blue, Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov issued an ultimatum, saying that either Kyiv meets Moscow&rsquo;s demands or the issue would be decided by the army. What he meant was that there would be more missiles targeting key structures inside Ukraine. Lavrov&rsquo;s words were contrary to those of his boss. So, is Russia sending mixed signals to the world or simply staging a PR stunt?
Of late, Ukraine has been bolstered by additional aid from the US. President Joe Biden has given Patriot Missiles to Ukraine, to protect itself from incoming missiles. The US has, so far, supported Ukraine to the tune of some US$55 billion, which is considered a huge sum of money given the current state of the US economy.
Ways must be found to get both leaders&rsquo; intentions to converge and materialise in ways that could suspend the war for a while. The US would be a key player, as well the other members of NATO. Otherwise, both sides will continue to suffer and the war would intensify. It could even worsen and possibly end up as a nuclear war.
When the Republicans take over the lower House next month, there could be some change in the US policy towards Ukraine. After more than 300 days of fighting, there is no decisive military victory by either side, only a human calamity.
It is hoped that the leaders of this conflict will come to their senses and realise that the sooner they suspend the fighting the better. After all, Ukraine and Russia are blood brothers, so it is senseless to continue to fight.

In November 2022, multinational investment management and financial services company Morgan Stanley predicted that India&rsquo;s economy would account for one-fifth of global growth over the next decade.

The bloc represents economies that account for more than 80% of global GDP, about 75% of its commerce, and 60% of the population.&nbsp; The previous presidencies of G20 delivered significant results in global economic governance, ensuring macroeconomic stability, rationalising international taxation, relieving debt burden, and strongly recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, amongst many other outcomes.</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for international cooperation to deal with global issues, outlining the country&#039;s approach to the G20. He said that the challenges of &lsquo;climate change, terrorism, and pandemics can be solved not by fighting each other, but only by acting together&rsquo;. He underlined the need to &lsquo;depoliticise the global supply of food, fertilisers, energy, and medical products so that geopolitical tensions do not lead to humanitarian crises&rsquo;.</p><p>The theme for India&rsquo;s G20 presidency&mdash;One Earth, One Family, One Future&mdash;highlights the importance of an approach that unites the world in tackling the future and of meeting expectations of developing countries.&nbsp; About 200 global meetings in 56 locations across India are to be organised, primarily under the Finance track, consisting of eight work streams, and the Sherpa Track, consisting of 13 working groups. Fifteen high-level ministerial meetings will be held, including 1 of foreign and finance ministers. Twelve engagement groups will be organised for non-governmental entities such as think tanks, businesses, science institutions, youth, women, start-ups, and so on to provide advisory services through seminars, workshops, and conferences.</p><p>Amitabh Kant, India&rsquo;s G20 Sherpa, stated that India&rsquo;s presidency has to be inclusive, ambitious, decisive, and action oriented.&nbsp; This is a tall order given the multiple crises that characterise global governance systems and the current polarisation of international cooperation efforts. India has a tough task ahead to bring together an ambitious action-oriented comprehensive G20 agenda.&nbsp; In 2023, the task for India is crucial, given the lasting effects of the Russia&ndash;Ukraine conflict, western sanctions on energy trade, economic downturns, pandemic worries, and climate change issues that are testing the basic foundations of globalisation and an international cooperation architecture.</p><p>Given the prominence of the G20 president and the opportunity to shape global narratives, India may find that with great power comes great responsibility to translate its spirit of&nbsp; idealism, such as Lifestyle for Environment, which shows how individual and national environmentally sustainable and responsible choices can lead to more informed and transformative actions globally and contribute to a cleaner and greener global future.</p><p>How can India use the G20 mantle to establish a successful global architecture that looks beyond 2023?&nbsp; India could consider three action clusters for blending the philosophical idealism with pragmatic discourse.</p><p>First, the G20 is often criticised as a talk shop without a permanent secretariat or continuity in its policy mandate, often leading to disjointed outcomes and no concrete action with a compliance mechanism. India will have to maintain policy continuity from Indonesia if it wants to leave an imprint on the G20 discourse. Indonesia&rsquo;s priorities for 2022 were the global health architecture, digital transformation, and green energy transition. India has indicated that it will continue prioritising digitisation to transform lives. Other stated priority issues for India include health financing and digitisation of service delivery; digital public infrastructure and tech-enabled development; climate and disaster resilience; fight against economic crime; reforming the multilateral organisations and trade regimes; leveraging the circular blue economy; green financing, energy security, and the green hydrogen mission; accelerated pace of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) implementation; and women&rsquo;s empowerment.&nbsp; This is the stage that India inherits, not just as a promoter of continuity but as a country with a unique footprint of pragmatism and universal solidarity and that can act as an honest broker of domestic solutions for global challenges.</p><p>Second, India should seek policy synergy by championing certain issues of priority for the global South within G20 and that of Group of Seven (G7), the de facto custodian of global order. In 2023, with Japan as the chair, G7 wants to make united efforts to address major global economic, environmental, and social development challenges inclusively to benefit all countries.&nbsp; At the G20, India is prepared to steer discussions on reforming multilateral trade initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation, and climate change actions.&nbsp; These issues have previously featured in sub-regional forums, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; the African Union; India, Brazil, and South Africa alliance; the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation; and others. The four consecutive G20 presidencies by Indonesia, India, Brazil, and South Africa are a first in the history of the G20 and must be leveraged to get buy-in from a larger group of advanced G7 countries and emerging economies that the developing global South wishes to advance on the world stage. The presidencies could mean that greater attention is placed on countries falling behind on achieving the SDGs, fostering a global enabling environment for digital transformation, advancing the provision of global public goods, and fostering international cooperation to support developing countries in advancing their developmental ambitions in a common but differentiated way.</p><p>Third, geopolitical tensions arising from Europe, Asia, and Africa could derail the G20 discourse in 2023. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the G20 Italy to take on a more diplomatic role akin to that of the United Nations and obscured discussions regarding the G20&rsquo;s financial mandate. Indonesia held the G20 presidency in a world gripped by geopolitical events in Russia and Ukraine.&nbsp; Until the end, all major leaders were uncertain if they would agree to a joint statement, which was eventually forged in Bali. It is hard to predict several new issues that could unfold from now to September 2023.&nbsp; The post-pandemic scenario is still tipping towards a global recession next year. A universal sense prevails that 2023&ndash;2030 will be critical for sustaining the planet. More than 70 countries have crippling debts, which could result in another global crisis and may hijack the Delhi G20 summit agenda.&nbsp; As Indonesia&rsquo;s President did, India&rsquo;s Prime Minister or his special emissaries will have to travel to national capitals to ensure that India&rsquo;s long-awaited moment to lead and spearhead new idealism has arrived and that it can be transformed into pragmatic action at negotiating tables. For now, India is reasonably confident that it can rise to the occasion with its enhanced intellectual, administrative, and social capital, and upgraded bureaucracy with a carefully crafted consultation process.</p><p><em>This opinion piece was written by ERIA&#039;s&nbsp;&nbsp;Director of Research Strategy and Innovation,&nbsp;Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi.&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:52:"/uploads/news/20221221/reppti-1160202-1667826104.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:23:"Venkatachalam Anbumozhi";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:18837:"A Spirit of Idealism or Pragmatic Global Discourse?

What to Expect from Indiaâ€™s G20 Presidency By Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi,&nbsp;Director of Research Strategy and Innovation:&nbsp;India inherited the Group of Twenty (G20) presidency from Indonesia on 1 December 2022 and will convene the 18th G20 summit on 9&ndash;10 September 2023 in New Delhi.&nbsp; It assumes the rotating presidency of the G20, the economic steering committee for the world with a slew of issues that could alter the course of international interactions.&nbsp; Coincidentally, India assumes the presidency of the UN Security Council and will chair the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the world&rsquo;s largest regional forum, till September 2023.&nbsp; In May 2022, the Economist ran a cover story about India where it concluded that the country is now an outstanding economic reformer.

Since 2008, the G20, which comprises Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, T&uuml;rkiye, the UK, the US, and the European Union, has emerged as the world's premier intergovernmental forum, comprising developed and developing countries.

The theme for India&rsquo;s G20 presidency&mdash;One Earth, One Family, One Future&mdash;highlights the importance of an approach that unites the world in tackling the future and of meeting expectations of developing countries.&nbsp; About 200 global meetings in 56 locations across India are to be organised, primarily under the Finance track, consisting of eight work streams, and the Sherpa Track, consisting of 13 working groups.

Twelve engagement groups will be organised for non-governmental entities such as think tanks, businesses, science institutions, youth, women, start-ups, and so on to provide advisory services through seminars, workshops, and conferences.
Amitabh Kant, India&rsquo;s G20 Sherpa, stated that India&rsquo;s presidency has to be inclusive, ambitious, decisive, and action oriented.&nbsp; This is a tall order given the multiple crises that characterise global governance systems and the current polarisation of international cooperation efforts.

Given the prominence of the G20 president and the opportunity to shape global narratives, India may find that with great power comes great responsibility to translate its spirit of&nbsp; idealism, such as Lifestyle for Environment, which shows how individual and national environmentally sustainable and responsible choices can lead to more informed and transformative actions globally and contribute to a cleaner and greener global future.
How can India use the G20 mantle to establish a successful global architecture that looks beyond 2023?&nbsp; India could consider three action clusters for blending the philosophical idealism with pragmatic discourse.
First, the G20 is often criticised as a talk shop without a permanent secretariat or continuity in its policy mandate, often leading to disjointed outcomes and no concrete action with a compliance mechanism. India will have to maintain policy continuity from Indonesia if it wants to leave an imprint on the G20 discourse.

Second, India should seek policy synergy by championing certain issues of priority for the global South within G20 and that of Group of Seven (G7), the de facto custodian of global order. In 2023, with Japan as the chair, G7 wants to make united efforts to address major global economic, environmental, and social development challenges inclusively to benefit all countries.&nbsp; At the G20, India is prepared to steer discussions on reforming multilateral trade initiatives, counter-terrorism cooperation, and climate change actions.&nbsp; These issues have previously featured in sub-regional forums, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; the African Union; India, Brazil, and South Africa alliance; the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation; and others.

The G20 members all agree that the priorities in energy transition are accessibility, technology, and financing, underscoring the importance of international cooperation. For the global community to meet the Paris Agreement goals, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions must be reduced by 40 million tonnes (MT)&ndash;5.6 billion tonnes (BT) within the next 30 years, mainly through CCUS and carbon, capture, storage (CCS) applications in the iron, steel, chemicals, refineries, and power plant industries. ASEAN alone will require $1 billion per annum for CCUS investment by 2030. To meet CCUS deployment targets by 2030, research and innovation, combined with support from the government as well as public and private sectors, can establish the first steps towards commercialising CCUS.</p><p>In his keynote speech, Mr Tutuka Ariadji, Director-General of Oil and Gas of Indonesia&rsquo;s MEMR, focused on his country&rsquo;s green energy transition progress. &lsquo;To achieve net-zero emissions, the development of CCS and CCUS technologies will be very important for Indonesia to achieve its target,&rsquo; he explained. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that Southeast Asia must capture 25 MT of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;by 2030 and more than 200 MT by mid-century if the region is to meet its Paris Agreement commitments. Mr Ariadji emphasised the crucial role of supporting policies, investments, and collaboration with all parties to facilitate CCS and CCUS deployment and accessibility.</p><p>Mr Jun Arima, Senior Policy Fellow of ERIA and Co-Chair of G20 2022, shared insights about the state of carbon neutrality in ASEAN and Asia. Globally, the amount of captured CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;using CCUS will need to increase from 40 MT per year to 5.6 by 2050 to attain the Paris Agreement goals. However, to achieve the 1.5&deg;C , more than 6 GT of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;must be captured per year by 2050. Countries must explore all measures&mdash;from hydrogen energy to renewables to nuclear energy and CCUS&mdash;to make carbon neutrality feasible.</p><p>With substantial differences in approaches, emissions profiles, and economic development between ASEAN Member States, regional collaboration will be imperative to achieve economies of scale to reduce costs. Large investments must be accelerated to remove the barriers hindering industrial-scale CCUS from being achieved. Mr Arima explained how today&rsquo;s geopolitical tension will renew discussions on the role of fossil fuels in global energy security, thus deepening the importance of CCUS technologies.</p><p>Ms Kikuko Sinchi, Manager and Senior Researcher of Mitsubishi Research Institute, introduced her company&rsquo;s research study findings on CCUS value-chain costs. The study selected Blora Regency in Indonesia&rsquo;s Central Java for a retrofitted coal-fired power plant and found that capture costs comprised the highest proportion of CCUS expenditures, reaching over 70%. As MRI&rsquo;s finding is in line with other studies, Ms Sinchi called for further technological innovation and business models to drive down costs.</p><p>Dr Han Phoumin, Senior Energy Economist of ERIA, moderated the first panel discussion on making CCUS affordable by scaling up and technology innovation. Ms Samantha McCulloch, head of ERIA&rsquo;s CCUS Unit, underlined how there is no single cost for CCUS given the range of applications available. Nonetheless, it is the most mature and competitive option available to substantially reduce emissions close to zero, particularly for heavy industries. Given that commercialising CCUS applications in heavy industries is in its early stages, the potential for significant cost reduction is promising.</p><p>Mr Juho Lipponen, Coordinator of the Clean Energy Ministerial CCUS Initiative, cited five points regarding the feasibility of CCUS and CCS: (1) recognise and specify that CCUS is an option ready for deployment, (2) there is no single cost to CCUS, (3) enhanced technology development facilitates cost reduction, (4) governments should kickstart CCUS, and (5) international cooperation is vital. He recommended the Netherlands and the United Kingdom incentive system, which pays the difference between the price of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;capture per tonne and the carbon price.</p><p>Ms Emily Grubert, Deputy Assistant Secretary to the Office of Carbon Management&nbsp;in the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, joined via a pre-recorded video, covering the United States&rsquo; decarbonisation plans and approaching carbon management technologies from a justice perspective. &lsquo;We know that CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;removal is expensive today, but we believe that by focusing on sustainability and justice and really trying to understand where these technologies and pathways could fit into future decarbonisation, we have a large role to play in overall decarbonisation,&rsquo; she said.</p><p>Ms Guloren Turan, General Manager for Advocacy and Communication of the Global CCS Institute, remarked that a business model is a key driver of CCS growth. Developing economies of scale, including the establishment of clusters and networks, would further facilitate CCS advancements thus such business models have emerged as the preferred type for relevant stakeholders. The networks involved in the operation of CCS minimise risks, help sustain local businesses and economies, and create jobs. To meet climate targets, CCS capacity must increase by a hundredfold by 2050, requiring nearly $1 trillion over the next 3 decades. Stronger policies to incentivise investment, clarify crucial legal and regulatory issues, and define the role of CCS in meeting national climate goals are necessary to achieve net-zero emissions. To ease regional regulatory challenges, Ms Turan encouraged the ratification of a 2019 amendment of the London Protocol that would allow cross-border CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;transport.</p><p>Mr Kim Bye Bruun, Communications and Government Relations Director of the Northern Lights CCS Project, provided a glimpse into the project poised to become the world&rsquo;s first cross-border open-source CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;transport and storage infrastructure network when it starts operations in 2024. The first phase will be completed in mid-2024 with a CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;capture capacity of 1.5 MT per annum, with the company looking to expand it to 5 MT&ndash;7 MT per annum in the third phase towards 2030. He added that since Europe requires 600 MT of stored CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;annually, assistance from policymakers, industries, and organisations are fundamental to speed up project development.</p><p>This notable CCS project received 80% support from the Norwegian government during phase one. The second phase will comprise funding from the owners and excludes the capture side. According to Mr Bruun, the most significant legislation concerning CCS is the European Union Emissions Trading System, which saw captured CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;incentives rise from &euro;20 to &euro;100 per tonne in early 2022.</p><p>Closing the first panel discussion session, Dr Phoumin noted the significance of the discussions given how ASEAN stakeholders &lsquo;really want to understand CCUS costs, what needs to be done, what policies need to be in place, and what infrastructure investment&rsquo; is necessary for further dialogue and policy formulation.</p><p>The second panel discussion was moderated by Mr Saleh Abdurachman, a Committee Member of Oil and Gas Downstream Regulatory Agency of Indonesia&rsquo;s MEMR, who concentrated on how developing countries can implement CCUS and learn from Indonesia&rsquo;s best practices. Mr Tim Dixon, Director and General Manager of Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme, offered four activities that developing countries should implement to promote CCUS: (1) understand their national potential, (2) promote capacity building, (3) establish a centre of excellence in CCUS, and (4) share experiences with other developing countries and learn from them.</p><p>During the question and answer (Q&amp;A) session concerning ways to enhance collaboration, Mr Dixon suggested that Indonesia work with large oil and gas companies whilst upholding independent expertise. Centres of excellence, working groups, universities, and governments can help support knowledge-sharing initiatives.</p><p>Mr Rachmat Sule, lecturer at the Faculty of Mining and Mining Engineering at the Bandung Institute of Technology, and Mr Usman Pasarai, Senior Researcher at the Business Development Unit of Lemigas, spoke on the role of centres of excellence for CCS and CCUS. Mr Sule stated that his centre of excellence has cooperated with industry and international partners numerous times to conduct studies and projects, including a CCUS feasibility study at Tangguh Field. Mr Sule explained that his team with communities in Europe, Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, the United States, and Canada regarding CCS and CCUS regulations in Indonesia.</p><p>Mr Pasarai provided insights into CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which has been proven effective for increasing overall production whilst permanently storing injected CO<sub>2</sub>. Several studies have been conducted by his centre and Pertamina and supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Indonesia&rsquo;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry to assess CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR potential. A critical next step for Indonesia is to launch a pilot project which, if successful, can realise a commercial-scale CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR project that can store 14 BT of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;over a lifetime of 15 years and increase the oil recovery rate by 14%. During the Q&amp;A, Mr Sule shared how coordination was the most challenging aspect for a CCS and CCUS centre of excellence. Mr Pasarai added that since CCUS matters in Indonesia involve numerous agencies, ministries, and sectors, understanding the role of each party is essential to forging fruitful collaborations.</p><p>Mr Oki Muraza, Senior Vice President of Research and Technology Innovation at Pertamina, explained his company&rsquo;s part in accelerating CCUS deployment in Indonesia. Pertamina takes a multifaceted approach to unlocking the potential of CCS and CCUS fields in Indonesia, participating in the selection of injection sites, initiating collaboration on feasibility studies, and exploring CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;utilisation possibilities. The company has received wide-ranging support from Indonesia&rsquo;s Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology in addition to the Indonesia Endowment Funds for Education and the Ministry of Finance. Mr Muraza is optimistic that technological advancements can reduce capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational costs, thus improving the affordability of CCS and CCUS. When asked by Mr Abdurachman about the progress that can be shared with developing countries, Mr Muraza explained some pathways to reduce CAPEX. These include forming clusters or hubs with neighbouring industries, partnering with technology providers, and prioritising CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR before storage to generate additional revenue from oil sales. &nbsp;</p><p>Mr Darshak Mehta, Senior CCUS specialist at ADB, praised Indonesia&rsquo;s ongoing efforts in advancing CCUS since the country began its journey 20 years ago. Indonesia has learnt from other countries and has established a centre of excellence and retrained its workforce to cope with future CCUS deployment. Mr Mehta complimented Indonesia&rsquo;s decision to generate and direct resources towards streams that require money and Indonesia&rsquo;s efforts to work with the public and private sectors to reach the country&rsquo;s goals. During the Q&amp;A, he expressed ADB&rsquo;s readiness to assist developing countries with CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;storage, common CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;infrastructure, e-fuels, and business models. Although ADB has made clear that it will support various CCUS-related activities, however, EOR is excluded from the institution&rsquo;s pipeline.</p><p>In his closing remarks, Mr Koji Hachiyama, Chief Operating Officer of ERIA, underscored the need for continuous technological innovation, policy instruments, and government support to make CCUS and CCS scalable, affordable, and cost-competitive. Capacity building and knowledge sharing are equally critical as they enable policymakers to understand the elements of CCUS to facilitate required policies that &lsquo;best fit into each country&rsquo;s circumstance&rsquo;. Through platforms such as the G20 Summit and the Asia CCUS Network, key stakeholders can join forces, share good practices, and avoid potential mistakes, thus accelerating CCUS deployment and affordability.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:0:"";s:9:"video_url";s:28:"https://youtu.be/o4hCfLCTejE";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:27395:"Affordability of Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage Discussed Ahead of G20 Summit Affordability of Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage Discussed Ahead of G20 Summit Indonesia remains steadfast in trying to deploy carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technologies whilst ensuring their affordability.

However, to achieve the 1.5&deg;C , more than 6 GT of CO2&nbsp;must be captured per year by 2050. Countries must explore all measures&mdash;from hydrogen energy to renewables to nuclear energy and CCUS&mdash;to make carbon neutrality feasible.
With substantial differences in approaches, emissions profiles, and economic development between ASEAN Member States, regional collaboration will be imperative to achieve economies of scale to reduce costs. Large investments must be accelerated to remove the barriers hindering industrial-scale CCUS from being achieved. Mr Arima explained how today&rsquo;s geopolitical tension will renew discussions on the role of fossil fuels in global energy security, thus deepening the importance of CCUS technologies.
Ms Kikuko Sinchi, Manager and Senior Researcher of Mitsubishi Research Institute, introduced her company&rsquo;s research study findings on CCUS value-chain costs. The study selected Blora Regency in Indonesia&rsquo;s Central Java for a retrofitted coal-fired power plant and found that capture costs comprised the highest proportion of CCUS expenditures, reaching over 70%. As MRI&rsquo;s finding is in line with other studies, Ms Sinchi called for further technological innovation and business models to drive down costs.
Dr Han Phoumin, Senior Energy Economist of ERIA, moderated the first panel discussion on making CCUS affordable by scaling up and technology innovation. Ms Samantha McCulloch, head of ERIA&rsquo;s CCUS Unit, underlined how there is no single cost for CCUS given the range of applications available. Nonetheless, it is the most mature and competitive option available to substantially reduce emissions close to zero, particularly for heavy industries. Given that commercialising CCUS applications in heavy industries is in its early stages, the potential for significant cost reduction is promising.
Mr Juho Lipponen, Coordinator of the Clean Energy Ministerial CCUS Initiative, cited five points regarding the feasibility of CCUS and CCS: (1) recognise and specify that CCUS is an option ready for deployment, (2) there is no single cost to CCUS, (3) enhanced technology development facilitates cost reduction, (4) governments should kickstart CCUS, and (5) international cooperation is vital. He recommended the Netherlands and the United Kingdom incentive system, which pays the difference between the price of CO2&nbsp;capture per tonne and the carbon price.
Ms Emily Grubert, Deputy Assistant Secretary to the Office of Carbon Management&nbsp;in the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, joined via a pre-recorded video, covering the United States&rsquo; decarbonisation plans and approaching carbon management technologies from a justice perspective. &lsquo;We know that CO2&nbsp;removal is expensive today, but we believe that by focusing on sustainability and justice and really trying to understand where these technologies and pathways could fit into future decarbonisation, we have a large role to play in overall decarbonisation,&rsquo; she said.
Ms Guloren Turan, General Manager for Advocacy and Communication of the Global CCS Institute, remarked that a business model is a key driver of CCS growth. Developing economies of scale, including the establishment of clusters and networks, would further facilitate CCS advancements thus such business models have emerged as the preferred type for relevant stakeholders. The networks involved in the operation of CCS minimise risks, help sustain local businesses and economies, and create jobs. To meet climate targets, CCS capacity must increase by a hundredfold by 2050, requiring nearly $1 trillion over the next 3 decades. Stronger policies to incentivise investment, clarify crucial legal and regulatory issues, and define the role of CCS in meeting national climate goals are necessary to achieve net-zero emissions. To ease regional regulatory challenges, Ms Turan encouraged the ratification of a 2019 amendment of the London Protocol that would allow cross-border CO2&nbsp;transport.
Mr Kim Bye Bruun, Communications and Government Relations Director of the Northern Lights CCS Project, provided a glimpse into the project poised to become the world&rsquo;s first cross-border open-source CO2&nbsp;transport and storage infrastructure network when it starts operations in 2024. The first phase will be completed in mid-2024 with a CO2&nbsp;capture capacity of 1.5 MT per annum, with the company looking to expand it to 5 MT&ndash;7 MT per annum in the third phase towards 2030. He added that since Europe requires 600 MT of stored CO2&nbsp;annually, assistance from policymakers, industries, and organisations are fundamental to speed up project development.
This notable CCS project received 80% support from the Norwegian government during phase one. The second phase will comprise funding from the owners and excludes the capture side. According to Mr Bruun, the most significant legislation concerning CCS is the European Union Emissions Trading System, which saw captured CO2&nbsp;incentives rise from &euro;20 to &euro;100 per tonne in early 2022.
Closing the first panel discussion session, Dr Phoumin noted the significance of the discussions given how ASEAN stakeholders &lsquo;really want to understand CCUS costs, what needs to be done, what policies need to be in place, and what infrastructure investment&rsquo; is necessary for further dialogue and policy formulation.
The second panel discussion was moderated by Mr Saleh Abdurachman, a Committee Member of Oil and Gas Downstream Regulatory Agency of Indonesia&rsquo;s MEMR, who concentrated on how developing countries can implement CCUS and learn from Indonesia&rsquo;s best practices. Mr Tim Dixon, Director and General Manager of Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme, offered four activities that developing countries should implement to promote CCUS: (1) understand their national potential, (2) promote capacity building, (3) establish a centre of excellence in CCUS, and (4) share experiences with other developing countries and learn from them.
During the question and answer (Q&amp;A) session concerning ways to enhance collaboration, Mr Dixon suggested that Indonesia work with large oil and gas companies whilst upholding independent expertise. Centres of excellence, working groups, universities, and governments can help support knowledge-sharing initiatives.
Mr Rachmat Sule, lecturer at the Faculty of Mining and Mining Engineering at the Bandung Institute of Technology, and Mr Usman Pasarai, Senior Researcher at the Business Development Unit of Lemigas, spoke on the role of centres of excellence for CCS and CCUS. Mr Sule stated that his centre of excellence has cooperated with industry and international partners numerous times to conduct studies and projects, including a CCUS feasibility study at Tangguh Field. Mr Sule explained that his team with communities in Europe, Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, the United States, and Canada regarding CCS and CCUS regulations in Indonesia.
Mr Pasarai provided insights into CO2&nbsp;enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which has been proven effective for increasing overall production whilst permanently storing injected CO2. Several studies have been conducted by his centre and Pertamina and supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Indonesia&rsquo;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry to assess CO2-EOR potential. A critical next step for Indonesia is to launch a pilot project which, if successful, can realise a commercial-scale CO2-EOR project that can store 14 BT of CO2&nbsp;over a lifetime of 15 years and increase the oil recovery rate by 14%. During the Q&amp;A, Mr Sule shared how coordination was the most challenging aspect for a CCS and CCUS centre of excellence. Mr Pasarai added that since CCUS matters in Indonesia involve numerous agencies, ministries, and sectors, understanding the role of each party is essential to forging fruitful collaborations.
Mr Oki Muraza, Senior Vice President of Research and Technology Innovation at Pertamina, explained his company&rsquo;s part in accelerating CCUS deployment in Indonesia. Pertamina takes a multifaceted approach to unlocking the potential of CCS and CCUS fields in Indonesia, participating in the selection of injection sites, initiating collaboration on feasibility studies, and exploring CO2&nbsp;utilisation possibilities. The company has received wide-ranging support from Indonesia&rsquo;s Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology in addition to the Indonesia Endowment Funds for Education and the Ministry of Finance. Mr Muraza is optimistic that technological advancements can reduce capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational costs, thus improving the affordability of CCS and CCUS. When asked by Mr Abdurachman about the progress that can be shared with developing countries, Mr Muraza explained some pathways to reduce CAPEX. These include forming clusters or hubs with neighbouring industries, partnering with technology providers, and prioritising CO2-EOR before storage to generate additional revenue from oil sales. &nbsp;
Mr Darshak Mehta, Senior CCUS specialist at ADB, praised Indonesia&rsquo;s ongoing efforts in advancing CCUS since the country began its journey 20 years ago. Indonesia has learnt from other countries and has established a centre of excellence and retrained its workforce to cope with future CCUS deployment. Mr Mehta complimented Indonesia&rsquo;s decision to generate and direct resources towards streams that require money and Indonesia&rsquo;s efforts to work with the public and private sectors to reach the country&rsquo;s goals. During the Q&amp;A, he expressed ADB&rsquo;s readiness to assist developing countries with CO2&nbsp;storage, common CO2&nbsp;infrastructure, e-fuels, and business models. Although ADB has made clear that it will support various CCUS-related activities, however, EOR is excluded from the institution&rsquo;s pipeline.
In his closing remarks, Mr Koji Hachiyama, Chief Operating Officer of ERIA, underscored the need for continuous technological innovation, policy instruments, and government support to make CCUS and CCS scalable, affordable, and cost-competitive. Capacity building and knowledge sharing are equally critical as they enable policymakers to understand the elements of CCUS to facilitate required policies that &lsquo;best fit into each country&rsquo;s circumstance&rsquo;. Through platforms such as the G20 Summit and the Asia CCUS Network, key stakeholders can join forces, share good practices, and avoid potential mistakes, thus accelerating CCUS deployment and affordability.             2022-04-13 13 April 2022 2202 lirpA 31 31-40-2202             .ytilibadroffa dna tnemyolped SUCC gnitarelecca suht ,sekatsim laitnetop diova dna ,secitcarp doog erahs ,secrof nioj nac sredlohekats yek ,krowteN SUCC aisA eht dna timmuS 02G eht sa hcus smroftalp hguorhT .;ouqsr&ecnatsmucric s;ouqsr&yrtnuoc hcae otni tif tseb;ouqsl& taht seicilop deriuqer etatilicaf ot SUCC fo stnemele eht dnatsrednu ot srekamycilop elbane yeht sa lacitirc yllauqe era gnirahs egdelwonk dna gnidliub yticapaC .evititepmoc-tsoc dna ,elbadroffa ,elbalacs SCC dna SUCC ekam ot troppus tnemnrevog dna ,stnemurtsni ycilop ,noitavonni lacigolonhcet suounitnoc rof deen eht derocsrednu ,AIRE fo reciffO gnitarepO feihC ,amayihcaH ijoK rM ,skramer gnisolc sih nI

The preliminary discussion received many valuable inputs from H.E. Stuart Calman, New Zealand&rsquo;s Ambassador to ASEAN; Prof Govinda Timilsina, Senior Research Economist, World Bank; Prof Kaliappa Kalirajan, Australian National University; Mr Takashi Hongo, Senior Fellow, Mitsui&nbsp;Global Strategic Studies Institute; Dr Kuki Soejachmoen, Co-founder and Executive Director, Indonesian Institute for Decarbonisation; and Dr Xianbin Yao, former&nbsp;Special Senior Advisor to the President and Director General of the Pacific Department, Asian Development Bank.</p><p>Introducing the discussion, Dr Anbumozhi explained the regulatory fragmentation of carbon pricing in ASEAN and the problematic utilisation of subsidies to brown assets. He said the study would help mainstream and standardise the use of carbon pricing in ASEAN by identifying prioritised technical and policy areas through literature, the Energy-Economy-Environment (E3) regional econometrics model, and stakeholder mapping and surveys in all ASEAN Member States.</p><p>Prof Timilsina shared his knowledge on carbon taxation in developing countries, analysing energy and emission structures from China and Cote D&rsquo; Ivoire. He said his about Carbon Taxes showed that carbon taxation results in GDP losses. He added, however, that the economic loss from carbon taxation is considered smaller than the economic losses from other policies, and that the benefit of health from carbon taxation cannot be ignored. To minimise GDP losses, he suggested revenue-recycling schemes and carbon taxation to look into the country&rsquo;s type of economy. Citing China&rsquo;s relatively export-oriented economy, he said a carbon tax and revenue recycling scheme to cut corporate income tax favourable to export-oriented industries could minimise economic losses. Citing another finding for Cote D&rsquo; Ivoire, he said a carbon tax could provide incentives to the labour force to move from informal production to formal production activities when carbon tax revenue is recycled to cut the labour tax in the formal sector.</p><p>Ambassador Calman shared New Zealand&rsquo;s ETS features and operation as an input to be considered for ASEAN. He said, compared with the carbon tax, ETS is preferred as it allows participants to plan and manage their obligations. He added that ETS covers all sectors and gases, although the agriculture sector, which is the biggest source of emissions, does not yet face the ETS price and consultation is underway on how it should be included in the ETS or an alternative mechanism. He said that features of ETS used are auctions and output-based free allocation to emission-intensive and trade-exposed industrial producers. He noted that auction revenues from ETS reach NZD1 billion per year and are being used for a Climate Emergency Response Fund to support low-carbon transition. He highlighted the importance of regulatory culture and compliance, including simplicity and efficiency of policy design.</p><p>Prof Kaliappa discussed Australia&rsquo;s emission policy, where the country does not levy explicit carbon pricing or a tax but instead utilises and exports low-emission technology. He said Australia&rsquo;s Climate Change Bill 2022 is committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. This, he added, is reflected in the commitment of each state and territory and cited Tasmania, which pursued 100% use of renewable energy by 2022. He observed that the use of coal is starting to wane and predicted its exit ahead of schedule. Prof Kaliappa reported Australia&rsquo;s involvement in regional cooperation with ASEAN countries, such as Viet Nam, through Aus4Innovation to strengthen the latter&rsquo;s innovation system. He pointed out that the negative impacts of carbon tax would be complemented by technological innovation, gradual increase in carbon tax, and financial support to poorer households. He added that ASEAN resource-rich countries can pursue all options like green and blue hydrogen.</p><p>Mr Hongo shared insights about Japan&rsquo;s government-led voluntary ETS. He argued that a voluntary emission trading system would be an easier measure to adopt for countries that often face opposition to carbon taxation. He noted, however, that the voluntary system works because many companies are willing to announce their targets and disclose them and their progress to the public.

The study, led by Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi, ERIA&rsquo;s Director of Research Strategy and Innovation, aims to examine implementation of carbon-pricing schemes in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asian Summit (EAS) countries, the potential of reducing distortionary effects of carbon energy tax by lump-sum transfer of revenues, and implications of industry sector competitiveness. The preliminary discussion received many valuable inputs from H.E. Stuart Calman, New Zealand&rsquo;s Ambassador to ASEAN; Prof Govinda Timilsina, Senior Research Economist, World Bank; Prof Kaliappa Kalirajan, Australian National University; Mr Takashi Hongo, Senior Fellow, Mitsui&nbsp;Global Strategic Studies Institute; Dr Kuki Soejachmoen, Co-founder and Executive Director, Indonesian Institute for Decarbonisation; and Dr Xianbin Yao, former&nbsp;Special Senior Advisor to the President and Director General of the Pacific Department, Asian Development Bank.
Introducing the discussion, Dr Anbumozhi explained the regulatory fragmentation of carbon pricing in ASEAN and the problematic utilisation of subsidies to brown assets. He said the study would help mainstream and standardise the use of carbon pricing in ASEAN by identifying prioritised technical and policy areas through literature, the Energy-Economy-Environment (E3) regional econometrics model, and stakeholder mapping and surveys in all ASEAN Member States.
Prof Timilsina shared his knowledge on carbon taxation in developing countries, analysing energy and emission structures from China and Cote D&rsquo; Ivoire. He said his about Carbon Taxes showed that carbon taxation results in GDP losses. He added, however, that the economic loss from carbon taxation is considered smaller than the economic losses from other policies, and that the benefit of health from carbon taxation cannot be ignored. To minimise GDP losses, he suggested revenue-recycling schemes and carbon taxation to look into the country&rsquo;s type of economy. Citing China&rsquo;s relatively export-oriented economy, he said a carbon tax and revenue recycling scheme to cut corporate income tax favourable to export-oriented industries could minimise economic losses. Citing another finding for Cote D&rsquo; Ivoire, he said a carbon tax could provide incentives to the labour force to move from informal production to formal production activities when carbon tax revenue is recycled to cut the labour tax in the formal sector.
Ambassador Calman shared New Zealand&rsquo;s ETS features and operation as an input to be considered for ASEAN. He said, compared with the carbon tax, ETS is preferred as it allows participants to plan and manage their obligations. He added that ETS covers all sectors and gases, although the agriculture sector, which is the biggest source of emissions, does not yet face the ETS price and consultation is underway on how it should be included in the ETS or an alternative mechanism. He said that features of ETS used are auctions and output-based free allocation to emission-intensive and trade-exposed industrial producers. He noted that auction revenues from ETS reach NZD1 billion per year and are being used for a Climate Emergency Response Fund to support low-carbon transition. He highlighted the importance of regulatory culture and compliance, including simplicity and efficiency of policy design.
Prof Kaliappa discussed Australia&rsquo;s emission policy, where the country does not levy explicit carbon pricing or a tax but instead utilises and exports low-emission technology. He said Australia&rsquo;s Climate Change Bill 2022 is committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. This, he added, is reflected in the commitment of each state and territory and cited Tasmania, which pursued 100% use of renewable energy by 2022. He observed that the use of coal is starting to wane and predicted its exit ahead of schedule. Prof Kaliappa reported Australia&rsquo;s involvement in regional cooperation with ASEAN countries, such as Viet Nam, through Aus4Innovation to strengthen the latter&rsquo;s innovation system. He pointed out that the negative impacts of carbon tax would be complemented by technological innovation, gradual increase in carbon tax, and financial support to poorer households. He added that ASEAN resource-rich countries can pursue all options like green and blue hydrogen.
Mr Hongo shared insights about Japan&rsquo;s government-led voluntary ETS. He argued that a voluntary emission trading system would be an easier measure to adopt for countries that often face opposition to carbon taxation. He noted, however, that the voluntary system works because many companies are willing to announce their targets and disclose them and their progress to the public. It is important, he said, to prioritise energy saving. He remarked that post-evaluation mechanisms complement commitments made by the corporation, and social pressure can push corporate efforts to reduce emissions, especially by those with large emissions.
Shifting the focus of discussion from developed countries to developing ones, Dr Soejachmoen explained that the implementation of the carbon market in Indonesia is stalled due to the country&rsquo;s regulatory conflicts in implementing carbon pricing and taxation. He said evidence-based and transparent policymaking and synergies between ministries are still needed to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of programmes.
Adding China&rsquo;s carbon pricing experience into the discussion, Dr Yao shared that carbon abatement is part of China&rsquo;s quality-of-growth and further reform strategy. He said that as a complementary instrument, ETS schemes have been introduced gradually over time and that central and local government agencies are actively involved in facilitating climate ambition. He reported that ETS in China covers the power sector and uses an intensity-based approach instead of cap and trade. He noted that a pragmatic and prudent policy design is important as every following action will be started with policy. He added that mitigation mechanisms for the &lsquo;losing party&rsquo; due to policy need to be looked at as well.
The discussion concluded with a reflection on ASEAN&rsquo;s nationally determined contribution targets and the reality in the field. The participants agreed that learning from other non-ASEAN countries, policy coherence, a good synergy between domestic institutions, collaboration with private institutions to finance the just transition and technological innovations, subsidies or incentives targeted to support green transformation, and monitoring mechanisms would help accelerate the transition. They acknowledged that ASEAN must be able to find the right purpose for imposing a carbon market.

Within the diverse community of ERIA Member States alone, a variety of measures for survival have been tackled in attempts to balance each nation&rsquo;s health and economy.</p><p>Discussing this balance were Dr Sovann Ly, Advisor to the Ministry of Health as Secretary of State in Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Prof Kun Tang, Member of the World Health Organisation COVID-19 Global Research Roadmap Social Science Group, Vanke School of Public Health, Tsinghua University, in Beijing, China; Dr Lili Yan Ing, Lead Advisor for Southeast Asia, ERIA, in Jakarta, Indonesia; Prof Alex Cook, Vice Dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore; and Dr Tran Thi Mai Oanh, Director of Health Strategy and Policy Institute, in Hanoi, Viet Nam. The programme was opened by Dr Takuma Kato, ERIA Healthcare Unit&rsquo;s Director, and moderated by Dr Antonio Villanueva, ERIA Healthcare Unit&rsquo;s Senior Advisor on Healthcare Policy, and Ms Asuka Nagatani, ERIA Healthcare Unit&rsquo;s Senior Policy Officer. Ms Isabella Gentajaya, ERIA&rsquo;s Information and Communications Department Senior Assistant, moderated the question-and-answer and closing portions. &nbsp;</p><p>Dr Ly, representing Cambodia as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 2022 Chair, reported that Cambodia&rsquo;s public health systems have been well-prepared to be resilient and sustainable against sudden health crises through effective surveillance, available field teams and equipment, 24/7 access, and simplified logistics and hierarchy. He stated that most people have received their fourth or fifth dose of COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p>Prof Tang presented a comprehensive overview of China&rsquo;s COVID-19 policies and practices on resilience and innovation, with focus on reproductive health. He said that China definitively focused on containment, especially in the populous urban centres such as Shanghai from March to May 2022. He mentioned essential health services that were disrupted, citing as an example his team&rsquo;s study on COVID-19&rsquo;s impact on various aspects of reproductive health, which revealed a decrease in sexual activity, apparently to avoid pregnancy. Asked about China&rsquo;s stand on Western mRNA vaccines, he answered that whilst China focuses on local traditional vaccines, an mRNA equivalent has recently been released and approved in Indonesia.</p><p>Dr Ing assessed COVID-19&rsquo;s impacts on Southeast Asia&rsquo;s economy, now aggravated by geopolitical tensions. She also summarised the region&rsquo;s overall recovery response, citing as examples Singapore, which is hardest hit because of tremendous losses in tourism, and the Philippines, which is experiencing double-digit unemployment. She reported that reactions from ASEAN have included an increase in targeted fiscal interventions and monetary interventions such as managing interest rates. She recommended that the next steps should focus on temporary social protection policies, fiscal policies to maintain lower fiscal deficits and a manageable range of interest rates, and operational policies to improve supply and logistics in response to increasing demands.</p><p>Prof Cook focused on Singapore&rsquo;s low-COVID-19 approach as opposed to a zero-COVID-19 one, stating that this is being managed by targeting high-risk groups whilst procuring large quantities of vaccines to mitigate the virus. In this manner, he said, extreme lockdowns are avoided. He added that the targeted measures include regular mass testing at, for example, offices and universities, manual and digital contact tracing of those at highest risk, encouraging social distancing, mask-wearing outside the home, institutional isolation to reduce household secondary infections, a quarantine system that includes migrant populations, and admittedly lengthy risk-stratified border restrictions. Moreover, Singapore&rsquo;s policies are gradually being relaxed through an evidence-based approach and home-grown modelling applications that are readily available to policymakers.</p><p>Dr Oanh reported that Viet Nam successfully combatted the first wave of the pandemic by prioritising health over economy. Measures taken, he said, included political commitment and multi-stakeholder collaboration, early case detection and strict quarantine especially at the borders, aggressive third-degree contact tracing, quick strategic testing in areas with community transmission, a timely and transparent public communications campaign, and, most importantly, participative individual and community engagement. The commune system in Viet Nam, he noted, has stimulated a culture of positive citizen action. He pointed out that when 90% of the population had already been vaccinated by October 2021, measures were relaxed, with social distancing applied only in high-risk areas, which thus supported economic recovery. For the new normal, he said the government now focuses on policies to support socio-economic development, including fiscal packages, loans with zero interest, social protection packages, and others, as well as enhanced preparation for future pandemics.</p><p>Dr Ly was asked how Cambodia has adjusted its COVID-19 policies to accommodate the rapid influx of visitors as the country is ASEAN Chair for 2022. He answered that the COVID-19 vaccine requirement and testing at the borders have been lifted, and the new requirement for delegates is to be tested before attending meetings. Otherwise, only thermal scanning is practised.</p><p>Dr Cook was asked if Singapore&rsquo;s policies on targeted populations could be successfully applied to larger Member States. He answered that it should be possible. He was asked on how Singapore has been able to implement policies to reach purported sources of infection, such as migrant workers. He said that because of the sudden outbreak of cases in areas with a high density of migrant workers, quarantine measures are restrictive and that dormitory living conditions are being studied to prevent such incidents from recurring.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr Oanh &nbsp;was asked how Viet Nam was able to encourage citizens unwilling to follow the new COVID-19 rules to comply with health measures. She said that whilst citizens comply through participative action, those who do not comply are subject to punitive measures. However, she said, few are affected because community engagement remains high and friendly.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:112:"/uploads/news/20221013/2022_oct_covid-19-pandemic-best-policy-strategies-balancing-health-and-economy-part-2.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:48:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgGv3u6OrD4&t=2s";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:15105:"COVID-19 Pandemic Best Policy Strategies: Balancing Health and Economy (Part 2) COVID-19 Pandemic Best Policy Strategies: Balancing Health and Economy (Part 2) Jakarta, 13 October 2022: The Healthcare Unit and the Communications and Information Department of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) held the second virtual regional conference on Pandemic Best Policy Strategies: Balancing Health and Economy (Part 2) on 13 October 2022.

She said that whilst citizens comply through participative action, those who do not comply are subject to punitive measures. However, she said, few are affected because community engagement remains high and friendly.             2022-10-13 13 October 2022 2202 rebotcO 31 31-01-2202             .yldneirf dna hgih sniamer tnemegagne ytinummoc esuaceb detceffa era wef ,dias ehs ,revewoH .serusaem evitinup ot tcejbus era ylpmoc ton od ohw esoht ,noitca evitapicitrap hguorht ylpmoc snezitic tslihw taht dias ehS .serusaem htlaeh htiw ylpmoc ot selur 91-DIVOC wen eht wollof ot gnilliwnu snezitic egaruocne ot elba saw maN teiV woh deksa saw;psbn& hnaO rD

Derry Aman, Indonesia&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to ASEAN, suggested that ERIA conduct research on ways and means to streamline the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP), which was announced in 2019. AOIP serves as a guideline for dialogue partners to engage ASEAN in maritime cooperation, connectivity, sustainable development, economic issues, and other concerns. Indonesia will chair ASEAN in 2023. &nbsp; Thai Ambassador to ASEAN Urawadee Sriphiromya proposed that ERIA initiate some special research or works to commemorate the 50th anniversary of ASEAN&ndash;Japan relations, and recognise Japan&rsquo;s contribution to ASEAN in the past 5 decades.             2022-12-02 2 December 2022 2202 rebmeceD 2 20-21-2202             .sedaced 5 tsap eht ni NAESA ot noitubirtnoc s;ouqsr&napaJ esingocer dna ,snoitaler napaJ;hsadn&NAESA fo yrasrevinna ht05 eht etaromemmoc ot skrow ro hcraeser laiceps emos etaitini AIRE taht desoporp aymorihpirS eedawarU NAESA ot rodassabmA iahT ;psbn& .3202 ni NAESA riahc lliw aisenodnI .snrecnoc rehto dna ,seussi cimonoce ,tnempoleved elbaniatsus ,ytivitcennoc ,noitarepooc emitiram ni NAESA egagne ot srentrap eugolaid rof enilediug a sa sevres PIOA .9102 ni decnuonna saw hcihw ,)PIOA( cificaP-odnI eht no kooltuO NAESA eht enilmaerts ot snaem dna syaw no hcraeser tcudnoc AIRE taht detseggus ,NAESA ot evitatneserpeR tnenamreP s;ouqsr&aisenodnI ,namA yrreD .I.M rodassabmA

<p>The success of the G20 in Bali has turned President Widodo Joko into a global leader for overcoming divisions regarding the war in Ukraine. The G20 leaders' declaration was issued, surprising everyone. Behind the scenes, however, kudos went to India which helped draft the communique. Now, India, as the current G20 chair, will be out right in the front row with all eyes watching. What will India's agenda be? What is India up to?</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi minced no words last week when he said that the world is facing great challenges such as climate change, terrorism, and pandemics. Therefore, the global community should act together and not fight one another.</p>
<p>What will the world's largest democracy's G20 agenda be? Judging from India's growing confidence and leadership, New Delhi will not be shy in placing its interests and those of other developing countries up front. India wants to see collective leadership in tackling global issues such as climate change, food security, cyber security threats, etc.</p>
<p>Mr Modi reiterated that the G20's priorities would be shaped in consultation with both G20 partners as well as partners in the global South, whose voices often go unheard. "We will encourage an honest conversation among the most powerful countries -- on mitigating risks posed by weapons of mass destruction and enhancing global security."</p>
<p>India does have an ambitious agenda for the G20, which industrialised members might find puzzling as it reflects very little of what the West has in mind. At various diplomatic gatherings over here, one could read some of the tea leaves about what India plans to do. Obviously, the overarching theme, which has been referred to often, would be "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam", speaking spiritually. In plain English, these two Sanskrit words mean "one earth, one family, one future" -- or something like that. If that is the case, India will have to be Hanuman the hero in the Ramayana epic who is agile and can perform all kinds of miracles and somersaults.</p>
<p>As the incoming G20 chair, India has to build on the agenda from what has been achieved or in certain cases deferred to from the previous summit in Bali. Indonesia was very clear on three aspects: the global health system, energy transition, and digital transformation. Obviously, these three goals would be included in the agenda of India.</p>
<p>In fact, India has already listed quite a few priorities apart from the key issues raised in Bali. These include the circular economy, public infrastructure, disaster risk and resilience, digitalisation in development, and women-led development.</p>
<p>Given the current global situation dominated by superpower rivalries coupled with their actions and policies, both visible and invisible, India would like to promote the voices of the Global South that have been ignored. Actually, the loudest voice has been India's, especially about the war in Ukraine. Other countries that share similar positions have gone unreported. As such, New Delhi wishes to see more inclusive and collective responsibility for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>After all, it is the South that has been the major victim of actions and policies perpetrated by industrialised countries. For instance, the Ukraine war has caused all-around negative impacts on developing and poor countries throughout the world. India has been pitching without taking sides. This position will remain the case during its G20 chairmanship. Russian President Vladimir Putin was missing from the Bali meeting but with India as chair, Mr Putin will be obliged to attend the summit next year.</p>
<p>Whatever plans India has in mind would certainly be aligned with the Asean agenda. India's position on the Ukraine war has won accolades in Asean, which has displayed very diverse viewpoints and positions. The bloc appreciates New Delhi's unwavering stand. Last month, New Delhi was accorded comprehensive strategic partnership (CSP) in the wee hours before their leaders met in Phnom Penh. Geopolitical values outweigh economic interests in granting CSP to India. The Asean-India Trade in Goods Agreement or AITIG was signed. But implementation has been sluggish. Now, with the CSP, India's stature is on par with China, the US, and Australia as they are all in the top tier of the bloc's dialogue partners. From this perspective, India can be the new champion and speak on behalf of Asean in addition to Indonesia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under India's leadership, two of the most important items for the G20 would be the promotion of awareness of youth as well as empowerment and women-led development. These are the future for the world, regardless of country. The younger generation has yet to absorb the old world which has been kept intact by analogue technology which requires deep thinking minus the "like" or "dislike" emojis. Youth and women will be India's signature agenda items next year.</p>
<p>These days, young people look to the future via smartphones. Their future can be clicked on and off but the real world is different. The chairmanship will definitely try to showcase India's start-ups in all areas. Some surveys say India's start-ups have grown exponentially to 72,993 in 2022 from 471 in 2016.</p>
<p>In addition, women are one of the important resources in global development, as they provide the foundation for families and are quite often the victims in conflict situations. The highlighting of these challenges would further promote the leadership of the Indian chair as issues from the Global South would be reiterated by the host.</p>

This assessment was made by Mr Nishimura Yasutoshi, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, at the 2nd Extraordinary Governing Board Meeting held at the headquarters of ASEAN Secretariat. The 3-hour interactive meeting touched on economic issues that would speed up the post&ndash;COVID-19 pandemic economic recovery.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &lsquo;ERIA has been working to improve connectivity by increasing investment in Asia, promoting economic partnership agreements, including RCEP [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership], developing infrastructure, and building a reliable supply chain&rsquo;, said the minister in a speech read by Mr Watanabe Tetsuya, Special Advisor to the Minister. &nbsp;He said that given the current world situation, it was important to grow and to solve social issues and provide sustainability to ensure that Asia was on a sustainable growth track. He added that it was timely for ERIA to launch a new centre to utilise digital innovation and achieve a sustainable economy. He announced Japan&rsquo;s budget of JPY5 billion for the project.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of ASEAN&ndash;Japan diplomatic relations, the minister reiterated Japan&rsquo;s goal of working with ASEAN&mdash;seen as the next engine of growth&mdash;to overcome mutual challenges by establishing a strong digital economy, realising carbon neutrality, and coping with aging societies.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &rsquo;Together, we will create a vision to illustrate an ideal future for mutual prosperity while ensuring that the voice of the business sector is taken into consideration.

This assessment was made by Mr Nishimura Yasutoshi, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, at the 2nd Extraordinary Governing Board Meeting held at the headquarters of ASEAN Secretariat. The 3-hour interactive meeting touched on economic issues that would speed up the post&ndash;COVID-19 pandemic economic recovery. &nbsp; &lsquo;ERIA has been working to improve connectivity by increasing investment in Asia, promoting economic partnership agreements, including RCEP [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership], developing infrastructure, and building a reliable supply chain&rsquo;, said the minister in a speech read by Mr Watanabe Tetsuya, Special Advisor to the Minister. &nbsp;He said that given the current world situation, it was important to grow and to solve social issues and provide sustainability to ensure that Asia was on a sustainable growth track. He added that it was timely for ERIA to launch a new centre to utilise digital innovation and achieve a sustainable economy. He announced Japan&rsquo;s budget of JPY5 billion for the project.&nbsp;  On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of ASEAN&ndash;Japan diplomatic relations, the minister reiterated Japan&rsquo;s goal of working with ASEAN&mdash;seen as the next engine of growth&mdash;to overcome mutual challenges by establishing a strong digital economy, realising carbon neutrality, and coping with aging societies. &nbsp; &rsquo;Together, we will create a vision to illustrate an ideal future for mutual prosperity while ensuring that the voice of the business sector is taken into consideration.

With this latest mission, India has put into low-earth orbit a total of 381 foreign satellites. OneWeb is a joint venture between India Bharti Global and the U.K. government, and it plans to have a constellation of about 650 satellites to offer communication services, with the launch of a further 36 satellites by January.</p><p>India is now the second-largest satellite communication (SATCOM) market in the world. India&rsquo;s space and communication technology programs have progressed exponentially in recent years, and from a developmental perspective, the space industry in India could propel the next tech-based economic revolution.&nbsp;</p><p>The global space industry is likely to exceed $1 trillion by 2040, but there is a shortage of commercial vehicles for putting into orbit multiple satellites to form a constellation. Due to the Ukraine crisis, Russian rockets are not in consideration now by several global SATCOMs, while Europe&rsquo;s Arianespace and NASA programs are getting delayed and becoming more costly, and the commercial potential of Chinese rockets is not accepted by the West.&nbsp;</p><p>This gives India an opportunity to take up the slot. India currently constitutes only 2-3% of the global space economy. The country has become proficient in operating low-cost space projects; it makes good returns from satellite construction and space launch services to a large roster of international clients.&nbsp;</p><h2>Space Is a Powerful Driver of Development</h2><p>Integrated space and satellite communications is a powerful development driver and can potentially modernize the Indian economy by enabling&nbsp;<a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/portal-in-portal/satcom/blogs/satellite-communication-a-new-age-solution-for-connecting-india/92070723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">village connectivity, education and skill development, health care and telemedicine</a>, warehousing, public distribution systems, and many other applications. The low-orbit space sector provides remote local areas with rapid data connectivity due to its rapid deployment, reliability and scalability.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2022 edition of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/Home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Innovation Index</a>&nbsp;(GII), put India in the top 40 countries for the first time; India&rsquo;s continued rise is due partly to its improvements in space, information and communication technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The 2022 government budget listed the space economy as an important sunrise opportunity, with immense potential to assist sustainable economic growth at scale. Out of the total space budget spent from 1969 to 2021, about 40% has been dominated by capital expenditure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>A Push to Let in the Private Sector</h2><p>Although space and communication technologies have touched all walks of life, the risky nature of space has attracted much less private investment.

With this latest mission, India has put into low-earth orbit a total of 381 foreign satellites. OneWeb is a joint venture between India Bharti Global and the U.K. government, and it plans to have a constellation of about 650 satellites to offer communication services, with the launch of a further 36 satellites by January.
India is now the second-largest satellite communication (SATCOM) market in the world. India&rsquo;s space and communication technology programs have progressed exponentially in recent years, and from a developmental perspective, the space industry in India could propel the next tech-based economic revolution.&nbsp;
The global space industry is likely to exceed $1 trillion by 2040, but there is a shortage of commercial vehicles for putting into orbit multiple satellites to form a constellation. Due to the Ukraine crisis, Russian rockets are not in consideration now by several global SATCOMs, while Europe&rsquo;s Arianespace and NASA programs are getting delayed and becoming more costly, and the commercial potential of Chinese rockets is not accepted by the West.&nbsp;
This gives India an opportunity to take up the slot. India currently constitutes only 2-3% of the global space economy. The country has become proficient in operating low-cost space projects; it makes good returns from satellite construction and space launch services to a large roster of international clients.&nbsp;
Space Is a Powerful Driver of Development
Integrated space and satellite communications is a powerful development driver and can potentially modernize the Indian economy by enabling&nbsp;village connectivity, education and skill development, health care and telemedicine, warehousing, public distribution systems, and many other applications. The low-orbit space sector provides remote local areas with rapid data connectivity due to its rapid deployment, reliability and scalability.&nbsp;
The 2022 edition of the&nbsp;Global Innovation Index&nbsp;(GII), put India in the top 40 countries for the first time; India&rsquo;s continued rise is due partly to its improvements in space, information and communication technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 2022 government budget listed the space economy as an important sunrise opportunity, with immense potential to assist sustainable economic growth at scale. Out of the total space budget spent from 1969 to 2021, about 40% has been dominated by capital expenditure.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A Push to Let in the Private Sector
Although space and communication technologies have touched all walks of life, the risky nature of space has attracted much less private investment. Private enterprises have been limited to being suppliers to the government&rsquo;s space programs, which has a combined civilian and military purpose. Sectoral activities are governed by a few international treaties along with two national policies, which are Satellite Communication Policy (SATCOM) and Remote Sensing Data Policy.&nbsp;
Realizing that centralized control creates weaker incentives, the Indian government&nbsp;brought in reforms&nbsp;to the space sector in 2020 to drive greater decentralization and provide a greater role for the private sector to accelerate the diffusion of global space technologies.&nbsp;
The&nbsp;Indian Space Association (ISpA)&nbsp;was founded in 2021, with the broad objective of&nbsp; bringing critical global technology and private investments into the country. This rebalancing of public and private priorities is a significant step, as it should increase the shared global goal of large-scale, cost-effective space economy programs.&nbsp;
'With its mixture of cost-effective technologies, budding startup culture, and an abundance of youth, India has the potential to become a world leader in the global space economy.'
The government has also started the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) as a single-window agency to promote private investments, nurturing startups and foreign companies&rsquo; technological innovation and commercialization of proven technologies from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). IspA and IN-SPACe are expected to make India a leader in the global space industry.
These steps have started to garner&nbsp;attention from the private sector. Elon Musk&rsquo;s U.S. Starlink system has acquired a license to operate as a subsidiary in the Indian space sector. Bharti Airtel&rsquo;s OneWeb, which is a collaboration with the U.K. government, is also planning to launch satellite services, and Canada&rsquo;s Telesat and Nelco, a Tata Group company, hopes to join the race by 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But new space startups and international investors need to be able to create a synergy with the government&rsquo;s flagship programs like Digital India, Start-Up India, Skill India and schemes like Smart Cities Mission.&nbsp;
There could also be a role for jointly developing an innovation ecosystem for Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence, and big data that could address some of the challenges in social infrastructure development in India. Around 20-25% of India&rsquo;s population reside in places that cannot easily be covered by terrestrial telecom and lack mobile and internet access.&nbsp;
Still Significant Obstacles
With its mixture of cost-effective technologies, budding startup culture, an abundance of youth, technological know-how, and with domestic institutions like ISRO acting as a springboard, India has the potential to become a world leader in the global space economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the next 10 years will test its preparedness, as there are a number of potential pitfalls. One big challenge is that India&rsquo;s civilian and military defense programs are heavily intertwined in the space sector, which requires regulatory approval for sensitive technological investments and innovations.&nbsp;
Multiple policy issues need to be resolved while drafting an integrated strategy for space technologies for propelling economic growth. The SATCOM Industry Association (SiA), ISRO, IN-SPACe and ISpA must work together with other ministries to maximize the benefits for everyone and everywhere.&nbsp;
Finally, given India&rsquo;s considerable developmental infrastructure needs, the space economy will need to become a fundamental driver behind efforts to bring a more equal distribution of benefits across society.

The event was organised by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) and the Institute of Developing Economics-Japan External Trade Organization (IDE-JETRO).</p><p>RIN is a network of research institutes from 16 East Asia Summit countries whose function is to support research activities of ERIA by providing it with country information and research findings and advising on its research theme and policy recommendations. RIN encourages dissemination of ERIA&rsquo;s research outcome to policymakers, political leaders, and opinion leaders, and supports ERIA&rsquo;s capacity-building programmes. IDE-JETRO serves as its Secretariat.</p><p>Prof Hidetoshi Nishimura, President of ERIA, opened the gathering by welcoming the RIN members and thanking &nbsp;IDE-JETRO for its support. Prof Nishimura reported the institute&rsquo;s participation in the EAS Economic Ministerial meeting, the G20 Trade in Digital Economy meeting, and the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit.&nbsp;He said that ERIA&rsquo;s research and activities have been brilliant, calling the 2022 achievements of the institute the best since its establishment 14 years ago. He said ERIA was acknowledged at the ASEAN Summit, the ASEAN Plus Three Summit, and the East Asia Summit.</p><p>Prof Nishimura had attended the 2nd Global Dialogue on the side-line of the ASEAN-related summit in Phnom Penh, where he discussed the Comprehensive Asia Development Plan 3.0 (CADP 3.0) and recommended ways to transform the digitalised economy of ASEAN and East Asia.</p><p>&nbsp;As the event&rsquo;s moderator, RIN Chairperson Dr Hank Lim Giok-Hay, from the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said that RIN has strategic advantages and has helped the region integrate through its numerous research studies and dialogues. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> Two members were admitted to the network: the Macroeconomic Research Institute of the Lao Academy of Social and Economic Sciences and the Institute of Malaysian and International Studies. The first was represented by its Director General, Ms Latdawanh Songvilay, and the second by its Director, &nbsp;Dr Sufian Jusoh. &nbsp;</p><p>Mr Atsusuke Kawada, President of the Bangkok Research Center, JETRO Bangkok/IDE-JETRO, gave a comprehensive report on RIN activities in the past 13 years. He said that in 2020, RIN launched the RIN Online Workshop Series to promote research exchange and share amongst its member institutes the latest knowledge and views on ASEAN and East Asian economies. The online workshop series continued in 2021 and 2022 with six workshops.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Dr Shiro Armstrong, Director of the Australian&ndash;Japan Research Center, Crawford School of Public Policy of the Australian National University, briefed the participants on economics and national security. He outlined RIN projects that related to the region&rsquo;s future trajectory in economic and national security. He said that ERIA and RIN are supporting a new book, <em>Economic and National Security</em>, which will be released in the first quarter of 2023.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Mr Nguyen Anh Duong, Director of the Central Institute for Economic Management, Viet Nam, focused on RIN activities in 2023 with some recommendations. He forecast that the global economy would see more volatility and uncertainties due to geopolitical rivalry and tensions as well as macroeconomic imbalance. He suggested that RIN members consider issuing a joint statement on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). He reported that his institute is offering to host a webinar on IPEF in September or October 2023.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Two ERIA economists assessed the institute&rsquo;s research activities, including CADP 3.0: Prof Fukunari Kimura commented on CADP 3.0 whilst Dr Keita Oikawa discussed the ASEAN Plus Three Research Project for Closing the Digital Divide in Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A session was devoted to the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) where Dr Dionisius A. Narjoko, ERIA&rsquo;s Senior Economist, discussed the significance and challenges of RCEP; Dr Kazunobu Hayakawa, Vice President of the Bangkok Research Center, JETRO Bangkok/IDE-JETRO, presented a detailed study on the RCEP utilisation and trade creation; and Mr Fusanori Iwasaki, ERIA&rsquo;s Director for Policy Research, assessed RCEP from the perspective of international relations.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The final session focused on the outcome of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, and the challenges that India, the next G20 host, will face.

The event was organised by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) and the Institute of Developing Economics-Japan External Trade Organization (IDE-JETRO).
RIN is a network of research institutes from 16 East Asia Summit countries whose function is to support research activities of ERIA by providing it with country information and research findings and advising on its research theme and policy recommendations. RIN encourages dissemination of ERIA&rsquo;s research outcome to policymakers, political leaders, and opinion leaders, and supports ERIA&rsquo;s capacity-building programmes. IDE-JETRO serves as its Secretariat.
Prof Hidetoshi Nishimura, President of ERIA, opened the gathering by welcoming the RIN members and thanking &nbsp;IDE-JETRO for its support. Prof Nishimura reported the institute&rsquo;s participation in the EAS Economic Ministerial meeting, the G20 Trade in Digital Economy meeting, and the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit.&nbsp;He said that ERIA&rsquo;s research and activities have been brilliant, calling the 2022 achievements of the institute the best since its establishment 14 years ago. He said ERIA was acknowledged at the ASEAN Summit, the ASEAN Plus Three Summit, and the East Asia Summit.
Prof Nishimura had attended the 2nd Global Dialogue on the side-line of the ASEAN-related summit in Phnom Penh, where he discussed the Comprehensive Asia Development Plan 3.0 (CADP 3.0) and recommended ways to transform the digitalised economy of ASEAN and East Asia.
&nbsp;As the event&rsquo;s moderator, RIN Chairperson Dr Hank Lim Giok-Hay, from the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said that RIN has strategic advantages and has helped the region integrate through its numerous research studies and dialogues.  &nbsp; Two members were admitted to the network: the Macroeconomic Research Institute of the Lao Academy of Social and Economic Sciences and the Institute of Malaysian and International Studies. The first was represented by its Director General, Ms Latdawanh Songvilay, and the second by its Director, &nbsp;Dr Sufian Jusoh. &nbsp;
Mr Atsusuke Kawada, President of the Bangkok Research Center, JETRO Bangkok/IDE-JETRO, gave a comprehensive report on RIN activities in the past 13 years. He said that in 2020, RIN launched the RIN Online Workshop Series to promote research exchange and share amongst its member institutes the latest knowledge and views on ASEAN and East Asian economies. The online workshop series continued in 2021 and 2022 with six workshops. &nbsp; Dr Shiro Armstrong, Director of the Australian&ndash;Japan Research Center, Crawford School of Public Policy of the Australian National University, briefed the participants on economics and national security. He outlined RIN projects that related to the region&rsquo;s future trajectory in economic and national security. He said that ERIA and RIN are supporting a new book, Economic and National Security, which will be released in the first quarter of 2023. &nbsp; Mr Nguyen Anh Duong, Director of the Central Institute for Economic Management, Viet Nam, focused on RIN activities in 2023 with some recommendations. He forecast that the global economy would see more volatility and uncertainties due to geopolitical rivalry and tensions as well as macroeconomic imbalance. He suggested that RIN members consider issuing a joint statement on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). He reported that his institute is offering to host a webinar on IPEF in September or October 2023. &nbsp; Two ERIA economists assessed the institute&rsquo;s research activities, including CADP 3.0: Prof Fukunari Kimura commented on CADP 3.0 whilst Dr Keita Oikawa discussed the ASEAN Plus Three Research Project for Closing the Digital Divide in Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises. &nbsp; A session was devoted to the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) where Dr Dionisius A. Narjoko, ERIA&rsquo;s Senior Economist, discussed the significance and challenges of RCEP; Dr Kazunobu Hayakawa, Vice President of the Bangkok Research Center, JETRO Bangkok/IDE-JETRO, presented a detailed study on the RCEP utilisation and trade creation; and Mr Fusanori Iwasaki, ERIA&rsquo;s Director for Policy Research, assessed RCEP from the perspective of international relations. &nbsp; The final session focused on the outcome of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, and the challenges that India, the next G20 host, will face. Dr Yose Rizal Damuri, Executive Director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, discussed and evaluated Indonesia&rsquo;s G20 presidency by analysing the need for a stronger recovery from the economic downturns and the need to balance other competing interests. Speaking online from New Delhi, Prof Sachin Chaturvedi, Director General of the Research and Information System for Developing Countries, previewed India&rsquo;s G20 chairmanship. &nbsp; During the discussion, Mr Koji Hachiyama, ERIA&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer, stressed that although digitalisation is a key element, more needs to be done to make cost management more efficient and to control production and sale processes to allow companies to create new business models and sources of revenue. To fulfil the policy agenda, he said ERIA will establish a new centre for digital innovation and sustainable economy within the institute next year.  In his closing remarks, Prof Nishimura said ERIA would spare no efforts in promoting regional economic integration and sustainable economic development through digitalisation in the East Asia region by conducting multi-faceted research in key areas such as the economy, energy, environment, healthcare, and on issues related to agriculture.             2022-11-24 24 November 2022 2202 rebmevoN 42 42-11-2202             .erutlucirga ot detaler seussi no dna ,erachtlaeh ,tnemnorivne ,ygrene ,ymonoce eht sa hcus saera yek ni hcraeser detecaf-itlum gnitcudnoc yb noiger aisA tsaE eht ni noitasilatigid hguorht tnempoleved cimonoce elbaniatsus dna noitargetni cimonoce lanoiger gnitomorp ni stroffe on eraps dluow AIRE dias arumihsiN forP ,skramer gnisolc sih nI  .raey txen etutitsni eht nihtiw ymonoce elbaniatsus dna noitavonni latigid rof ertnec wen a hsilbatse lliw AIRE dias eh ,adnega ycilop eht lifluf oT .eunever fo secruos dna sledom ssenisub wen etaerc ot seinapmoc wolla ot sessecorp elas dna noitcudorp lortnoc ot dna tneiciffe erom tnemeganam tsoc ekam ot enod eb ot sdeen erom ,tnemele yek a si noitasilatigid hguohtla taht desserts ,reciffO gnitarepO feihC s;ouqsr&AIRE ,amayihcaH ijoK rM ,noissucsid eht gniruD ;psbn& .pihsnamriahc 02G s;ouqsr&aidnI deweiverp ,seirtnuoC gnipoleveD rof metsyS noitamrofnI dna hcraeseR eht fo lareneG rotceriD ,idevrutahC nihcaS forP ,ihleD weN morf enilno gnikaepS .stseretni gnitepmoc rehto ecnalab ot deen eht dna snrutnwod cimonoce eht morf yrevocer regnorts a rof deen eht gnisylana yb ycnediserp 02G s;ouqsr&aisenodnI detaulave dna dessucsid ,seidutS lanoitanretnI dna cigetartS rof retneC eht fo rotceriD evitucexE ,irumaD laziR esoY rD .ecaf lliw ,tsoh 02G txen eht ,aidnI taht segnellahc eht dna ,aisenodnI ,ilaB ni timmus 02G eht fo emoctuo eht no desucof noisses lanif ehT ;psbn& .snoitaler lanoitanretni fo evitcepsrep eht morf PECR dessessa ,hcraeseR yciloP rof rotceriD s;ouqsr&AIRE ,ikasawI ironasuF rM dna ;noitaerc edart dna noitasilitu PECR eht no yduts deliated a detneserp ,ORTEJ-EDI/kokgnaB ORTEJ ,retneC hcraeseR kokgnaB eht fo tnediserP eciV ,awakayaH ubonuzaK rD ;PECR fo segnellahc dna ecnacifingis eht dessucsid ,tsimonocE roineS s;ouqsr&AIRE ,okojraN .A suisinoiD rD erehw )PECR( pihsrentraP cimonocE evisneherpmoC lanoigeR del-NAESA eht ot detoved saw noisses A ;psbn& .sesirpretnE deziS-muideM dna ,llamS ,orciM ni ediviD latigiD eht gnisolC rof tcejorP hcraeseR eerhT sulP NAESA eht dessucsid awakiO atieK rD tslihw 0.3 PDAC no detnemmoc arumiK iranukuF forP :0.3 PDAC gnidulcni ,seitivitca hcraeser s;ouqsr&etutitsni eht dessessa stsimonoce AIRE owT ;psbn& .3202 rebotcO ro rebmetpeS ni FEPI no ranibew a tsoh ot gnireffo si etutitsni sih taht detroper eH .)FEPI( krowemarF cimonocE cificaP-odnI eht no tnemetats tnioj a gniussi redisnoc srebmem NIR taht detseggus eH .ecnalabmi cimonoceorcam sa llew sa snoisnet dna yrlavir lacitilopoeg ot eud seitniatrecnu dna ytilitalov erom ees dluow ymonoce labolg eht taht tsacerof eH .snoitadnemmocer emos htiw 3202 ni seitivitca NIR no desucof ,maN teiV ,tnemeganaM cimonocE rof etutitsnI lartneC eht fo rotceriD ,gnouD hnA neyugN rM ;psbn& .3202 fo retrauq tsrif eht ni desaeler eb lliw hcihw ,ytiruceS lanoitaN dna cimonocE ,koob wen a gnitroppus era NIR dna AIRE taht dias eH .ytiruces lanoitan dna cimonoce ni yrotcejart erutuf s;ouqsr&noiger eht ot detaler taht stcejorp NIR deniltuo eH .ytiruces lanoitan dna scimonoce no stnapicitrap eht defeirb ,ytisrevinU lanoitaN nailartsuA eht fo yciloP cilbuP fo loohcS drofwarC ,retneC hcraeseR napaJ;hsadn&nailartsuA eht fo rotceriD ,gnortsmrA orihS rD ;psbn& .spohskrow xis htiw 2202 dna 1202 ni deunitnoc seires pohskrow enilno ehT .seimonoce naisA tsaE dna NAESA no sweiv dna egdelwonk tsetal eht setutitsni rebmem sti tsgnoma erahs dna egnahcxe hcraeser etomorp ot seireS pohskroW enilnO NIR eht dehcnual NIR ,0202 ni taht dias eH .sraey 31 tsap eht ni seitivitca NIR no troper evisneherpmoc a evag ,ORTEJ-EDI/kokgnaB ORTEJ ,retneC hcraeseR kokgnaB eht fo tnediserP ,adawaK ekusustA rM

It is contradictory when we tell people to segregate waste at home, but the government only provides one bin to dump every waste into. There is no clear visibility that the mixed waste will be segregated and recycled at the end,&rsquo; she explained.</p><p><strong>Private Sector and Government Need to Move at the Same Pace</strong></p><p>The private sector in Thailand, according to Ms Techachoochert, is generally quite aware of and enthusiastic about addressing plastic pollution. However, despite the recent good news about the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) implementation, she thought the government is still relatively slow in responding to this issue.</p><p>&#039;The private sector is getting ready, but laws and policies are holding them back from moving forward,&#039; she said.</p><p>Ms Adam, however, believes private sector could elevate the environmental debate by simply adopting green practices without having to wait for policies to precede. &lsquo;Sure, policies should be put in place, but I strongly believe that each individual and organisation, each business, must take the initiatives on their own,&rsquo; she said.</p><p>She added that business owners can start small by evaluating their operational practices, switching plastic packaging to more sustainable alternatives, and forming partnerships with other stakeholders to ensure material circularity.</p><p>In terms of sustaining their business, Ms Sabrina believes social entrepreneurs need to balance their idealism and their adaptability. &lsquo;At the end of the day, as an entrepreneur, you need to sell. Otherwise, you cannot sustain your company. You need to create revenue, otherwise, you cannot create more impact,&rsquo; she said, adding that having the right business partner enables her to balance these two important sides.</p><p><strong>Various Government Supports to Accelerate Impactful Businesses</strong></p><p>When asked about other supports needed from the government, Dr Techachoochert said the government should be able to respond to the rapid changes quickly.</p><p>&lsquo;They used to give classification codes for products that come with containers but did not provide any codes for refilling products that come without containers. Despite this, we didn&rsquo;t give in, we kept pushing on. And then the government approached us to gain some insights from our business, and only later did they launch relevant policies after the shop had been already operational,&#039; she said.</p><p>Additionally, Ms Techachoochert hopes that the government could help promote the businesses and educate the public about the problem they are trying to solve through various communication channels under the authority.</p><p>In Malaysia, Ms Adam said a policy aiming to enable multistakeholder partnerships has been in place.

Although the policy is in place, the execution is another story. But I feel like it is a good first step towards it,&rsquo; she explained.</p><p>Ms Adam highlighted another big challenge: the lack of local recycling infrastructure. She said she hoped logistic support to set up the necessary infrastructure, especially from the government, could come into place.</p><p>Ms Sabrina, meanwhile, urged the government to allow SMEs like her own to be the supplier for government projects.</p><p>&lsquo;Our team has worked hard to create reliable products at a competitive price, and despite having ample supply of non-recyclable plastic waste to create eco-friendly construction material, the demand for our products is not up to par. We believe the opportunity to be a government supplier will significantly leverage our business and the impact we could create.&rsquo; she said.</p><p>Mr Michikazu Kojima, Senior Advisor to the President on Environmental Issues at ERIA who also leads the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris, reiterated the important roles played by the private sector to lead the way for a more circular economy for plastics.</p><p>&#039;I believe we can all agree that the private sector plays an instrumental role in our collective efforts to put a break on the current trend of plastic pollution. With its economic leverage, the private sector has the potential to nudge the conventional and linear way of plastic consumption and production towards a more circular one,&#039; said Mr Kojima.</p><p>Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, the Director of Strategy and Partnerships of ERIA, said entrepreneurs and business models can really offer very important solutions for this pressing global challenge. &lsquo;Therefore, it is very important also for policymakers to hear from entrepreneurs and innovators,&#039; Dr Marsan said.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:48:"/uploads/news/20221103/esi-webinar-1_800x450.png";s:9:"video_url";s:48:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpweUy52w8c&t=3s";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:18019:"Entrepreneurship in the Environmental Field: Insights from Women-led Businesses on Tackling Plastic Waste Entrepreneurship in the Environmental Field: Insights from Women-led Businesses on Tackling Plastic Waste Jakarta, 3 November 2022: The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) through a collaboration between the Entrepreneurship, Startups, and Innovation&nbsp;(E-S-I) Knowledge Lab&nbsp;and the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris&nbsp;(RKC-MPD)&nbsp;hosted a webinar on 3 November 2022, titled 'Female Entrepreneurs in the ASEAN Region: Innovation to Tackle Marine Plastic Waste'. This webinar aimed to raise awareness about the alarming marine plastic pollution and highlight the innovative efforts taken by the private sector in addressing the issue.
The webinar invited three female entrepreneurs addressing plastic waste issues in the region&mdash;Ms Ovy Sabrina&nbsp;of&nbsp;Rebricks Indonesia,&nbsp;Dr Supatchaya Techachoochert&nbsp;of&nbsp;Refill Station&nbsp;in Thailand, and&nbsp;Ms Juliana Adam&nbsp;of&nbsp;Biji-biji Initiative&nbsp;in Malaysia&mdash;who shared their respective stories, including challenges and lessons learned that came along their journey as sustainability entrepreneurs.
The three women admitted that their forays into sustainable business were somewhat accidental, but the goal was similar: Promoting zero waste lifestyle.
&lsquo;Me and my partner, Novita, were beginning to practice the lifestyle when we realised there are certain types of plastic waste that we cannot recycle,&rsquo; said Ms Sabrina, referring to her business partner, Rebrick CEO, Novita Tan.
Not wanting to 'pass down' non-recyclable plastic waste to their children&rsquo;s generation, both came up with an idea to recycle plastic waste into building materials and founded Rebricks Indonesia.
As for Ms Adam, it was the endeavour to generate alternative incomes for underserved community members in Malaysia that led her way to become an entrepreneur. Together with her team, she is working to improve the livelihood of others while also championing environmental sustainability through her waste recycling and management company, Biji-biji Initiative.
Meanwhile, Dr Techachoochert&rsquo;s interest in the business grew when living alternately between the forest and the city for her doctoral research in Biology.&nbsp; As she observed how most environmental problems are rooted in urban lifestyle, she decided to open Refill Station to raise public awareness of plastic waste. Today, that first bulk store in Thailand she co-founded with her friends is more than just a business.
'Having a store is a kind of communication channel, so I have more room to express my interest, talk about the problem, and I can point out what other alternatives that people can do to help,' Ms Techachoochert explained.
Changing Consumer Behaviour: Between Incentives and Facilities
In the efforts to encourage recycling behaviour, the ability to compromise is important for entrepreneurs to have. Dr Techachoochert learned that taking a hard-liner approach will lose people&rsquo;s adherence. She believes that by being a leader who is adaptive and able to compromise, one can set an example that could encourage people to follow.
Ms Adam observed how in Malaysia, giving incentives to make people segregate and recycle their waste seems to work to build the habit of recycling among underserved community members. However, the same approach did not work as well for urban areas, she said.
The situation is similar with Indonesia. According to Ms Sabrina, incentives only worked for the area where such income had a meaningful impact. &lsquo;Urban communities, especially middle-class citizens, do not care about the incentives; they would take action only when a formal system is in place,&rsquo; she said.
Dr Techachoochert said that infrastructure should be in place to support people in segregating and recycling waste. She shared a story about a family member who used to segregate waste when living in Japan but stopped the practice once she moved back to Thailand.
&lsquo;Because there are no facilities to build trust. It is contradictory when we tell people to segregate waste at home, but the government only provides one bin to dump every waste into. There is no clear visibility that the mixed waste will be segregated and recycled at the end,&rsquo; she explained.
Private Sector and Government Need to Move at the Same Pace
The private sector in Thailand, according to Ms Techachoochert, is generally quite aware of and enthusiastic about addressing plastic pollution. However, despite the recent good news about the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) implementation, she thought the government is still relatively slow in responding to this issue.
'The private sector is getting ready, but laws and policies are holding them back from moving forward,' she said.
Ms Adam, however, believes private sector could elevate the environmental debate by simply adopting green practices without having to wait for policies to precede. &lsquo;Sure, policies should be put in place, but I strongly believe that each individual and organisation, each business, must take the initiatives on their own,&rsquo; she said.
She added that business owners can start small by evaluating their operational practices, switching plastic packaging to more sustainable alternatives, and forming partnerships with other stakeholders to ensure material circularity.
In terms of sustaining their business, Ms Sabrina believes social entrepreneurs need to balance their idealism and their adaptability. &lsquo;At the end of the day, as an entrepreneur, you need to sell. Otherwise, you cannot sustain your company. You need to create revenue, otherwise, you cannot create more impact,&rsquo; she said, adding that having the right business partner enables her to balance these two important sides.
Various Government Supports to Accelerate Impactful Businesses
When asked about other supports needed from the government, Dr Techachoochert said the government should be able to respond to the rapid changes quickly.
&lsquo;They used to give classification codes for products that come with containers but did not provide any codes for refilling products that come without containers. Despite this, we didn&rsquo;t give in, we kept pushing on. And then the government approached us to gain some insights from our business, and only later did they launch relevant policies after the shop had been already operational,' she said.
Additionally, Ms Techachoochert hopes that the government could help promote the businesses and educate the public about the problem they are trying to solve through various communication channels under the authority.
In Malaysia, Ms Adam said a policy aiming to enable multistakeholder partnerships has been in place. This policy fosters collaborations between big corporations, non-governmental organisations, and social enterprises to create a collective impact.
&lsquo;For example, recognising the impact that the third sector can create, and then ensuring support from the bigger players. Although the policy is in place, the execution is another story. But I feel like it is a good first step towards it,&rsquo; she explained.
Ms Adam highlighted another big challenge: the lack of local recycling infrastructure. She said she hoped logistic support to set up the necessary infrastructure, especially from the government, could come into place.
Ms Sabrina, meanwhile, urged the government to allow SMEs like her own to be the supplier for government projects.
&lsquo;Our team has worked hard to create reliable products at a competitive price, and despite having ample supply of non-recyclable plastic waste to create eco-friendly construction material, the demand for our products is not up to par. We believe the opportunity to be a government supplier will significantly leverage our business and the impact we could create.&rsquo; she said.
Mr Michikazu Kojima, Senior Advisor to the President on Environmental Issues at ERIA who also leads the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris, reiterated the important roles played by the private sector to lead the way for a more circular economy for plastics.
'I believe we can all agree that the private sector plays an instrumental role in our collective efforts to put a break on the current trend of plastic pollution. With its economic leverage, the private sector has the potential to nudge the conventional and linear way of plastic consumption and production towards a more circular one,' said Mr Kojima.
Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, the Director of Strategy and Partnerships of ERIA, said entrepreneurs and business models can really offer very important solutions for this pressing global challenge. &lsquo;Therefore, it is very important also for policymakers to hear from entrepreneurs and innovators,' Dr Marsan said.             2022-11-03 3 November 2022 2202 rebmevoN 3 30-11-2202             .dias nasraM rD ',srotavonni dna sruenerpertne morf raeh ot srekamycilop rof osla tnatropmi yrev si ti ,eroferehT;ouqsl& .egnellahc labolg gnisserp siht rof snoitulos tnatropmi yrev reffo yllaer nac sledom ssenisub dna sruenerpertne dias ,AIRE fo spihsrentraP dna ygetartS fo rotceriD eht ,nasraM enomjA ailuiG rD

Biden can now board Air Force One and leave for Phnom Penh and Bali to deliver his important message that America is back. After all, it was his intention since taking up the presidency two years ago to do just that.
It is interesting to note that, despite the US&rsquo;s growing involvement in the war in Ukraine, American voters are far more interested in issues related to economic hardship, inflation, abortion rights and the future of American democracy.

Lest we forget, he still has to juggle the Myanmar quagmire, the 17th East Asia Summit, not to mention domestic politics in between.
This will be Mr Hun Sen&rsquo;s third summit in Cambodia, and presumably his last, a rare act for any Asean leader to follow.

It forecasts that: nations are willingly jumping on China&rsquo;s bandwagon; that there is little likelihood of interstate war; there is extensive economic and financial cooperation, deepening regionalism, and that the region and its people are growing incrementally; and that there is a stable political order with a hierarchical structure.

Indeed, the one titled &ldquo;Nirvana&rdquo; is too good to be true with all regional and global development in equilibrium for economic and security spectrums and without the prospect of interstate wars. The worse scenario titled &ldquo;Home Alone&rdquo; depicts the world in disarray with national survival at stake as interstate wars rage, arms races both conventional and nuclear, and disruption of financial and economic transactions.

More than the officials would like to admit, despite different political system and ideologies, the so-called &ldquo;the Chinese characteristics&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Thai characteristics&rdquo; share more commonalities (tong yang xing) than divergences in the conduct of economic and certain aspects of security policies. Both countries want a peaceful and stable region with shared prosperity.</p><p>It is notably that China joined Apec as its first regional economic engagement in 1991, which helped the country to open up and the average tariff rate dropped 39.5 per cent to about 7.4 per cent. By 2020, China&rsquo;s trade with the Apec members have reached nearly US$3 trillion. With such a large economic, the world economic No. 2 can do a lot within the Apec framework. China has gained experience in utilizing science and technology, especially those related to sustainable development and green economy. Such expertise will fit and help Thailand to achieve the goals under the new economic model, known as &ldquo;Bio-Circular-Green Economy&rdquo; or BCG, which is also enshrined in the APLM&rsquo;s key outcome documents.</p><p>That helps also to explain why Thailand was among the first countries to join Group of Friends of Global Development Initiative (GDI), when Xi raised the idea at the United Nation General Assembly last September. Indeed, Thailand&rsquo;s BCG shares the same key concepts with the GDI, dwelling on people-centered prosperity as well as a balanced, sustainable and inclusive growth. In addition, these objectives are also the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p><p>Due to the absence of US President Joe Biden, who chose to attend the wedding of his grand daughter at the Whitehouse this weekend, the most powerful Apec leader taking part in the summit in Bangkok will inevitably be President Xi. His visit, the first as the head of state, to Thailand comes at a time when the global geo-strategic and economic landscape has shifted to Asia. As such, the international community is watching closely what Xi will say and do during his Nov 17-19 visit to Thailand. He will be accompanied by his wife, Madame Peng Liyuan, who has had a close rapport with Prayut&rsquo;s wife, Naraporn, since their first meeting in 2014 during the Beijing-hosted Apec and has been maintaining personal contacts. Xi visited Bangkok as Vice President in December 2011.</p><p>Fresh from the success of the 20th People&rsquo;s Congress, Xi could use the Apec platform to reassure the world that China is open and will continue to engage the international community. When he reported to Congress on the last day, he said the world needs China, and vice versa, China needs the world. With 21 economies and their leaders in-person converging in Bangkok as the threat from the Covid-19 pandemic subsides, Xi can reiterate this mantra, besides the trade and investment issues, with its commitment to contribute to the global common good including strengthening multilateralism, fighting the climate crisis, and promoting economic recovering, food and health security, among others.</p><p>As China becomes more affluent and confident, while in Bangkok, Beijing would like to send at least two clear messages to the global community. First and foremost, China has improved its economic engagement development and wants everybody to know that it is moving up to a high-quality economic model. China is a member of the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Beijing is also supportive of the planned Asia Pacific Free Trade Agreement. Second, from now on, China will want to raise its international profile and influence so that it can play a greater role in global governance. In a nutshell, China is no longer a spectator. In Bangkok, Xi is the right person in the right place at the right time. As re-elected leader for a third term, Xi&rsquo;s legacy is at stake; everything he pursues will be scrutinized to the tee.</p><p>From the region&rsquo;s vantage points, while they welcome China&rsquo;s rise and more expansive global profiles, quite a few countries are concern and very anxious about Beijing&rsquo;s new assertiveness. They hope that China in days to come would be able to mitigate and resolve current disputes or any possible hotspots with the concerned parties. If these objectives could be attained, it will certainly discourage the regional countries to seek extra outside supports or form new alliances that could detrimental to the bloc&rsquo;s solidarity and centrality as well as its ties with China.</p><p>After the APLM, Xi and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha now will have the opportunity to hold bilateral talks on 19 November. As both sides are commemorating the 10th anniversary of their comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, Thailand and China are looking for ways to rejuvenate their bilateral relations, as they prepare to commemorate their 50th anniversary 2025. In the Chinese tradition, when the relations reach 50 years, it is supposed to be &ldquo;the period to know all about life&rdquo; (wu shi zhi ming). That is to say, the Sino-Thai relationship have reached maturity and without doubt should be further elevated to a higher level to face up new challenges together. By that time, they hope to announce the establishment of Thailand-China Community with shared future for enhanced stability prosperity and sustainability.</p><p>That would be the task of the senior offices from the two countries. At present, Thailand and China have excellent cooperation in politics, security, trade, investment, digitalization, health, culture, education, tourism, science, and technology, the list goes on.</p><p>However, one area that needs to be further enhanced is the increased interactions between youth and community-based groups between the two countries. In addition, there is an urgent need for Thais to have a better awareness, understanding and appreciation of China&rsquo;s history and general affairs. Numerous seminars and discussions among the Thai officials and business sectors have often pointed to the lack of a well-rounded and comprehensive understanding of China&rsquo;s thinking and tradition among the Thai decision makers and academia.</p><p>Currently, nearly 900,000 Thais are studying putonghua (mandarin Chinese) with different levels of seriousness at all levels, thanked to Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, who is very keen on the language and culture of China. However, there seems to be no connection with the numbers of Thais taking up China as an area study. Today, there is a mere handful of Thai scholars who have an indigenous understanding of the Middle Kingdom. Thai studies are taught in 49 university with thousands of students study the Thai language.</p><p>It is also notable that before the outbreak of the pandemic, from 2013 to 2019, there were around 10 million Chinese tourists visiting Thailand annually&mdash;translating into just 30,000 persons on average everyday. With such an intense contacts and interaction, it is incumbent on their decision makers to find ways to transform these people-to-people exchanges more fruitful, durable and mutually beneficial beyond the photo-op and package tours.</p><p><em>This opinion piece was written by ERIA&#039;s Senior Communications Advisor, Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, and has been published in <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2437872/xis-visit-to-bangkok-east-wind-blowing">Bangkok Post</a>.&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:38:"/uploads/news/20221118/4525797_790.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:19937:"Xiâ€™s visit to Bangkok, East Wind Blowing Xiâ€™s visit to Bangkok, East Wind Blowing By Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, Senior Communications Advisor:&nbsp;Thailand gladly welcomes Chinese President Xi Jinping with three understandings at the forefront of its mind, namely that now is the Asian Century; that China is the undisputed leader; and that Thailand-China ties are consequential to peace and stability in the region.

Fresh from the success of the 20th People&rsquo;s Congress, Xi could use the Apec platform to reassure the world that China is open and will continue to engage the international community. When he reported to Congress on the last day, he said the world needs China, and vice versa, China needs the world. With 21 economies and their leaders in-person converging in Bangkok as the threat from the Covid-19 pandemic subsides, Xi can reiterate this mantra, besides the trade and investment issues, with its commitment to contribute to the global common good including strengthening multilateralism, fighting the climate crisis, and promoting economic recovering, food and health security, among others.
As China becomes more affluent and confident, while in Bangkok, Beijing would like to send at least two clear messages to the global community. First and foremost, China has improved its economic engagement development and wants everybody to know that it is moving up to a high-quality economic model. China is a member of the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Beijing is also supportive of the planned Asia Pacific Free Trade Agreement. Second, from now on, China will want to raise its international profile and influence so that it can play a greater role in global governance. In a nutshell, China is no longer a spectator. In Bangkok, Xi is the right person in the right place at the right time. As re-elected leader for a third term, Xi&rsquo;s legacy is at stake; everything he pursues will be scrutinized to the tee.
From the region&rsquo;s vantage points, while they welcome China&rsquo;s rise and more expansive global profiles, quite a few countries are concern and very anxious about Beijing&rsquo;s new assertiveness. They hope that China in days to come would be able to mitigate and resolve current disputes or any possible hotspots with the concerned parties. If these objectives could be attained, it will certainly discourage the regional countries to seek extra outside supports or form new alliances that could detrimental to the bloc&rsquo;s solidarity and centrality as well as its ties with China.
After the APLM, Xi and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha now will have the opportunity to hold bilateral talks on 19 November. As both sides are commemorating the 10th anniversary of their comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, Thailand and China are looking for ways to rejuvenate their bilateral relations, as they prepare to commemorate their 50th anniversary 2025. In the Chinese tradition, when the relations reach 50 years, it is supposed to be &ldquo;the period to know all about life&rdquo; (wu shi zhi ming). That is to say, the Sino-Thai relationship have reached maturity and without doubt should be further elevated to a higher level to face up new challenges together. By that time, they hope to announce the establishment of Thailand-China Community with shared future for enhanced stability prosperity and sustainability.
That would be the task of the senior offices from the two countries. At present, Thailand and China have excellent cooperation in politics, security, trade, investment, digitalization, health, culture, education, tourism, science, and technology, the list goes on.
However, one area that needs to be further enhanced is the increased interactions between youth and community-based groups between the two countries. In addition, there is an urgent need for Thais to have a better awareness, understanding and appreciation of China&rsquo;s history and general affairs. Numerous seminars and discussions among the Thai officials and business sectors have often pointed to the lack of a well-rounded and comprehensive understanding of China&rsquo;s thinking and tradition among the Thai decision makers and academia.
Currently, nearly 900,000 Thais are studying putonghua (mandarin Chinese) with different levels of seriousness at all levels, thanked to Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, who is very keen on the language and culture of China. However, there seems to be no connection with the numbers of Thais taking up China as an area study. Today, there is a mere handful of Thai scholars who have an indigenous understanding of the Middle Kingdom. Thai studies are taught in 49 university with thousands of students study the Thai language.
It is also notable that before the outbreak of the pandemic, from 2013 to 2019, there were around 10 million Chinese tourists visiting Thailand annually&mdash;translating into just 30,000 persons on average everyday. With such an intense contacts and interaction, it is incumbent on their decision makers to find ways to transform these people-to-people exchanges more fruitful, durable and mutually beneficial beyond the photo-op and package tours.

Furthermore, they stated that they would closely watch the activities of ERIA, which serves as a platform for the realization of CCUS in Asia, and of METI, which supports it.             2022-09-30 30 September 2022 2202 rebmetpeS 03 03-90-2202             .ti stroppus hcihw ,ITEM fo dna ,aisA ni SUCC fo noitazilaer eht rof mroftalp a sa sevres hcihw ,AIRE fo seitivitca eht hctaw ylesolc dluow yeht taht detats yeht ,eromrehtruF .erutuf raen eht ni tcejorp tolip SCC eht hcnual pleh ot modsiw rieht loop lliw seititne rehto dna ,seinapmoc ,seirtnuoc rebmem NCA taht demrifnoc osla yehT .lobmys lufrewop a sa tca lliw ereht tcejorp tolip SCC a gnitrats taht dna ,noitareneg rewop lamreht no tnedneped ylivaeh si hcihw ,noiger naisA eht rof laitnesse si ygolonhcet SUCC taht weiv eht derahs yehT

Bravo to the trio of Asean members for the outstanding success. A task that seemed impossible just a few weeks ago&nbsp;suddenly became a possibility. Indeed, if global leaders had some humility like the leaders in this part of the world, the outcome of these regional summits could serve&nbsp;as a stepping stone for peace and stability in the wider world. Southeast Asia could even shape the new international order in the making, as the hosts of three summits - Asean, G20, and Apec - have demonstrated.<br /><br />In early May, these three summit chairs were quite worried because the war in Ukraine erupted without warning as the trio were looking to play host for their big diplomatic events and raise their international&nbsp;profile. They even issued a joint statement pledge for support from their powerful dialogue partners to allow them the opportunities to do their jobs without disrupting or boycotting the meetings due to&nbsp;divisions caused by the war.</p><p>The statement said that these meetings "share commonalities that provide a unique opportunity for all participating countries/economies to jointly advance the collective global&nbsp;and regional agenda and efforts to bring peace, prosperity, and sustainable and inclusive development to all our peoples".<br /><br />Furthermore, the trio pledged to work with partners and stakeholders to ensure cooperation as member states continue to strengthen Asean centrality, credibility and relevance in maintaining peace and stability&nbsp;in their regional and global endeavours. And they have done exactly that. One can argue that it was pure luck that it turned out this way. Some pundits said it was by default or a fluke. Whatever the cause, the statements from the three summits demonstrated the ability of small states to skillfully encourage superpowers and others to adopt amiable attitudes and positions.<br /><br />During the Asean-related summits, Cambodia invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to attend. He dispatched his Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba instead to convince Asean to change sides and&nbsp;and back the West for Ukraine. In this, he failed but he did manage to speak out to the regional audience. Asean&#039;s positions on the biggest war in Europe since World War II are diverse and complex but&nbsp;they reflect the independent diplomatic mind of each member, which at this point in time has benefited the bloc as a whole.<br /><br />In Bali, the debate on the war continued, and this time there were some new elements.

Bravo to the trio of Asean members for the outstanding success. A task that seemed impossible just a few weeks ago&nbsp;suddenly became a possibility. Indeed, if global leaders had some humility like the leaders in this part of the world, the outcome of these regional summits could serve&nbsp;as a stepping stone for peace and stability in the wider world. Southeast Asia could even shape the new international order in the making, as the hosts of three summits - Asean, G20, and Apec - have demonstrated.In early May, these three summit chairs were quite worried because the war in Ukraine erupted without warning as the trio were looking to play host for their big diplomatic events and raise their international&nbsp;profile. They even issued a joint statement pledge for support from their powerful dialogue partners to allow them the opportunities to do their jobs without disrupting or boycotting the meetings due to&nbsp;divisions caused by the war.
The statement said that these meetings "share commonalities that provide a unique opportunity for all participating countries/economies to jointly advance the collective global&nbsp;and regional agenda and efforts to bring peace, prosperity, and sustainable and inclusive development to all our peoples".Furthermore, the trio pledged to work with partners and stakeholders to ensure cooperation as member states continue to strengthen Asean centrality, credibility and relevance in maintaining peace and stability&nbsp;in their regional and global endeavours. And they have done exactly that. One can argue that it was pure luck that it turned out this way. Some pundits said it was by default or a fluke. Whatever the cause, the statements from the three summits demonstrated the ability of small states to skillfully encourage superpowers and others to adopt amiable attitudes and positions.During the Asean-related summits, Cambodia invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to attend. He dispatched his Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba instead to convince Asean to change sides and&nbsp;and back the West for Ukraine. In this, he failed but he did manage to speak out to the regional audience. Asean's positions on the biggest war in Europe since World War II are diverse and complex but&nbsp;they reflect the independent diplomatic mind of each member, which at this point in time has benefited the bloc as a whole.In Bali, the debate on the war continued, and this time there were some new elements. Under the spell of Balinese dance and the aura of the world's third-largest democracy, some would surmise,&nbsp;the divided G20 leaders were able to agree on their Bali Declaration, including a 169-word paragraph condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the strongest terms -- something which no diplomats earlier&nbsp;felt would be possible. Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov attended the Bali summit, sitting in for President Vladimir Putin. He left the summit before the declaration was agreed upon but with his&nbsp;deputies present at the meeting.
Kudos must go to Indonesia, which was able to pool together all opposing forces to agree on the situation in Ukraine. The G20 communique was hailed as a milestone for President Joko Widodo's international profile as a peacemaker, not to mention that both Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden had chosen&nbsp;Bali as their meeting venue.
Rightly so, due to the successful release of the G20 leaders' communique, the outcome immediately ramped up the expectation of some of the G7 members at the Apec summit.&nbsp;As such, speculation was rife that a joint Apec ministerial statement might not be possible due to the opposing views of the West and other members from the region.

For the signing ceremony, Mr Hachiyama was accompanied by Dr Lili Yan Ing, Lead Advisor, Southeast Asia Region; Dr Aladdin Rillo, Senior Economic Advisor; Dr Fauziah Zen, Senior Economist; Dr Doan Thi Thanh Ha, Economist; and several ERIA staff from the research, legal, and communications departments.
Dr Riyatno, Deputy Chairman for Investment Cooperation at BKPM, warmly welcomed the ERIA delegation. He briefly explained the recent developments implemented by the government to improve the business and investment climate in the country, in line with the recent Law no. 11/2020 on Job Creation that &lsquo;reformed many regulations and the business licensing system in Indonesia.&rsquo;
&lsquo;We do hope that the collaboration will provide more government [policies] that [are formulated] based on theory and scientific evidence, as well as good regulatory practice, where a joint study conducted between two parties will deliver findings/innovations that have the potential to help [elevate] the role of investment in developing the local economy and strengthen the national economy,&rsquo; said Dr Riyatno.
Dr Indra Darmawan, BKPM&rsquo;s Deputy Chairman for Investment Planning, and Mr Pradana Indraputra, BKPM&rsquo;s Special Staff for National Entrepreneur Development, attended the signing ceremony.             2022-11-18 18 November 2022 2202 rebmevoN 81 81-11-2202             .ynomerec gningis eht dednetta ,tnempoleveD ruenerpertnE lanoitaN rof ffatS laicepS s;ouqsr&MPKB ,artupardnI anadarP rM dna ,gninnalP tnemtsevnI rof namriahC ytupeD s;ouqsr&MPKB ,nawamraD ardnI rD

However, it has also had beneficial features. Factory Asia has continued to produce and export during the pandemic, in contrast with North America and Europe. COVID-19 has boosted digitalisation, notably in information and communication technology (ICT). The adoption of ICT has boosted economic growth. Maintaining the competitiveness of international production networks and utilising digitalisation are essential to the region&rsquo;s future post-COVID-19.</p><p>Based on this understanding, the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) has developed<a title="Click here to download the publication for free" href="/publications/the-comprehensive-asia-development-plan-cadp-30-towards-an-integrated-innovative-inclusive-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the Comprehensive Asia Development Plan 3.0 (CADP 3.0)</a>. Since the previous version (CADP 2.0) in 2015, nearly seven years have passed. CADP 3.0 addresses the above-mentioned urgent concerns and discusses economic growth and social problem-solving in the region from the viewpoints of (i) integration, (ii) innovation, (iii) inclusiveness, and (iv) sustainability.</p><p>This research was the focus of the Symposium co-organised by ERIA and the Ministry of Commerce of the Royal Kingdom of Cambodia.&nbsp; In his Welcoming Remarks, His Excellency PAN Sorasak, Minister of Commerce for the Kingdom of Cambodia, commended ERIA for this research: &lsquo;We, the Royal Government of Cambodia, are focusing our efforts on all aspects of digitalisation. This study provides greater clarity to our efforts. I appreciate Prof. Nishimura and thank him and all the ERIA experts who have contributed to CADP 3.0, successfully providing a theoretical framework for the digital development of Asia along with comprehensive and valuable policy recommendations.&rsquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Elaborating on the contents of the book, he said &lsquo;CADP 3.0 addresses these issues ranging from emerging industries to energy, showing the way forward. I strongly agree with the idea that digitalisation is the key to upgrade traditional industries such as agriculture, generating vast opportunities for new businesses.

However, it has also had beneficial features. Factory Asia has continued to produce and export during the pandemic, in contrast with North America and Europe. COVID-19 has boosted digitalisation, notably in information and communication technology (ICT). The adoption of ICT has boosted economic growth. Maintaining the competitiveness of international production networks and utilising digitalisation are essential to the region&rsquo;s future post-COVID-19.
Based on this understanding, the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) has developed the Comprehensive Asia Development Plan 3.0 (CADP 3.0). Since the previous version (CADP 2.0) in 2015, nearly seven years have passed. CADP 3.0 addresses the above-mentioned urgent concerns and discusses economic growth and social problem-solving in the region from the viewpoints of (i) integration, (ii) innovation, (iii) inclusiveness, and (iv) sustainability.
This research was the focus of the Symposium co-organised by ERIA and the Ministry of Commerce of the Royal Kingdom of Cambodia.&nbsp; In his Welcoming Remarks, His Excellency PAN Sorasak, Minister of Commerce for the Kingdom of Cambodia, commended ERIA for this research: &lsquo;We, the Royal Government of Cambodia, are focusing our efforts on all aspects of digitalisation. This study provides greater clarity to our efforts. I appreciate Prof. Nishimura and thank him and all the ERIA experts who have contributed to CADP 3.0, successfully providing a theoretical framework for the digital development of Asia along with comprehensive and valuable policy recommendations.&rsquo;
&nbsp;Elaborating on the contents of the book, he said &lsquo;CADP 3.0 addresses these issues ranging from emerging industries to energy, showing the way forward. I strongly agree with the idea that digitalisation is the key to upgrade traditional industries such as agriculture, generating vast opportunities for new businesses. The deployment digital technology for social welfare concerns will help solve all kinds of complex social problems. I am confident that today&rsquo;s event will be beneficial to all the participants interested in what we must do for the future.&rsquo;
Prof Hidetoshi Nishimura, President of ERIA, expressed ERIA&rsquo;s deep gratitude to the Minister and the Ministry of Commerce for their continued support of ERIA.&nbsp; &lsquo;The event today also celebrates that special relationship between Cambodia as the Chair of ASEAN and ERIA.&rsquo; He then provided an overview of the CADP 3.0: &lsquo;CADP 3.0 presents that possible future of Asia, which will be more integrated, innovative, inclusive, and sustainable through digitalisation.&nbsp; To realise the vision set out in CADP 3.0, ASEAN and East Asia need to build a digital ecosystem where firms, governments, and public institutions employ shared data.&rsquo;
He went on to announce the new Centre for Digital Innovation and Sustainable Economy which ERIA will launch next year.
Mr Koji Hachiyama, ERIA&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer, introduced the new Centre in more detail during his closing remarks: &nbsp;&lsquo;The new Centre will provide a public-private platform to create unified rules across the region such as a common data platform and legal systems for securing data free flow and cybersecurity.&rsquo;&nbsp; Second, the platform will share information on digital and carbon-neutral economies.&nbsp; Third, it will serve as a training platform for industries on new business models, tools, and case studies.

They were supposed to come up with a set of decisions, which their leaders could approve when they meet on November 11<span class="s7">th</span>.

They were supposed to come up with a set of decisions, which their leaders could approve when they meet on November 11th. Now, the ASEAN leaders have to scrutinise the recommendations laid out in the various proposals and positions submitted by ASEAN members, some of which can be described as overzealous and others more benign.
During the special meeting, they could not agree whether they should continue to engage the State Administrative Council. On the one side, there is a strong urge to create a firewall against Myanmar&rsquo;s military junta. The idea is so strong that quite a few members back such a move, which will cut off Myanmar&rsquo;s representatives from all ASEAN members. These extensive bans would be tantamount to a suspension of Myanmar&rsquo;s membership, without directly saying so. This is one of several recommendations on which the ASEAN leaders will have to decide.
Other ASEAN members believe that ASEAN must adhere to the principles enshrined in the ASEAN treaty and stick to the 5 Point Consensus, or 5PC, which remains valid, even though this peace framework needs a few tweaks to put it more in tune with the realities on the ground and connect with the ongoing 5-point roadmap initiated by the State Administration Council (SAC) in April last year, before ASEAN came out with its own peace plan. At the moment, the SAC is implementing its own roadmap.
At the Jakarta meeting, there was a strong call by some ASEAN members to recognise the National Unity Government (NUG), as a big stick to push the military regime. Malaysia has made clear that it would allow the NUG to open a representative office in Kuala Lumpur. Other ASEAN members including Indonesia, the next ASEANchair, might follow suit in the coming days.
Obviously, engaging all stakeholders, as demanded by the ASEAN members, must be inclusive. For the time being, the SAC, due to the atrocities it has committed against its own people since last February, has been barred from ministerial meetings and summits. Some ASEAN members argue that,without the SAC engagement, political dialogue would not be able to proceed. Apparently, these members are losing ground due to the growing violence inflicted on civilians by the Tatmadaw (Myanmar&rsquo;s military).
Further isolating Myanmar would push the country deeper into the embrace of Russia, which is currently fighting a major war in Europe. Already, in the past several months, the Russia-Myanmar ties have been intensified in all areas of both civilian and military affairs. If this trajectory continues, there could be a proxy war next to the Thai border. China, India and Bangladesh also share common frontiers with the SAC.
A press release from the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 29th&nbsp;notes that Malaysia has proposed to ASEAN that it consider the inclusive humanitarian donor forum, as proposed by the NUG, to support the current ASEAN effort on humanitarian assistance. The ASEANleaders have to make a decision on this proposal, as a small European country has expressed the willingness to host this international conference.
Finally, when the ASEAN foreign ministers meet again ahead of the ASEAN summit on November 11th, they should agree on the tenure of the ASEAN special envoy. Kuala Lumpur has proposed that the position should last at least three years, to allow ample time for the envoy to pursue his or her work in effective and continuous ways.
Myanmar still has some time to show that its membership in ASEAN means something more than just words or acts of defiance. ASEAN&rsquo;s centrality will face a severe test if the grouping fails to ease the current tensions and open ways for future dialogue. ASEAN also risks becoming irrelevant in the eyes of the international community.
Indonesia, the incoming ASEAN chair, has informed the ministerial meeting that it will take a stronger stand against the brutal regime in Myanmar, unless there are positive developments on the ground.
Cambodia, as the current chair, will continue to work with Myanmar after the ASEAN summit. It is hopeful that, in that the weeks remaining until December 31st, Cambodia will be able to make progress on the 5PC, especially on the humanitarian assistance plan.
For the military junta, the timeframe is short, therefore some big decisions must be made before the arrival of new ASEAN chair.

For the US, the biggest challenge now is to compete with China, while at the same time containing Russia. That was the key message of the US&#039; national security strategy, which was released last Wednesday, at a time when the US no longer has the same agency to tackle the myriad&nbsp;of challenges it faces around the globe the way it used to.<br /><br />In the good old days following the end of World War II, the US called the shots on almost everything, dictating the rules on economic policies and security matters that eventually became the norm followed&nbsp;by the international community. Now, the global security landscape is not quite the same. The US no longer commands the respect of other nations the way it used to, nor does it have the power that it once&nbsp;had. This is reflected in Washington&#039;s latest security strategy, which sees the US adjusting its posture to the changed geopolitical situation, especially in the Indo-Pacific region.<br /><br />In the past seven decades, no country could challenge the US&#039; superiority in any area, allowing it to take the lead without any difficulty. Its sheer power meant any country which refused to follow the US lead would only meet a certain demise. But lately, American policymakers are becoming concerned as both the US&#039; allies and foes are increasingly coordinating their actions to voice their disapproval&nbsp;of Washington&#039;s actions.<br /><br />A case in point was Saudi Arabia&#039;s recent outright refusal to temporarily halt its oil production output to help rein in prices. In the past, Washington wouldn&#039;t have had any problems convincing the world&#039;s&nbsp;biggest oil exporter to bow to its wishes, but attitudes certainly have changed. Some Congress leaders have threatened to reprimand Riyadh by slashing its arms exports deal, but at this point, regardless&nbsp;of what the US plans to do, Saudi Arabia&#039;s decision will resonate badly for the US on the global stage.<br /><br />After World War II, the international community owed much to American leadership and its contributions to securing peace, stability, and prosperity. While the US remains a major global power, it must be&nbsp;able to win the hearts and minds of the international community. It has to be able to distinguish between friends and foes, and acknowledge the fact that its allies are at different stages of economic and political development.</p><p>It was thus unfortunate that the Biden administration decided to use democracy as the starting point for the fresh US bid to shape the future world.<br /><br />Washington believes that a democracy has the inherent capacity to course-correct, which in turn facilitates progress and improves overall resilience. That was true to a certain extent, but recent events&nbsp;in the US -- particularly in the past five years -- have shown how democracy can be extremely problematic, especially in light of the ongoing investigation into the Jan 6 Capitol riots.<br /><br />The quality of the discourse peddled by the Democrats and Republicans, and blind loyalty to their respective causes have sent shockwaves around the world. The comments coming out of American lawmakers&#039;&nbsp;mouths about their own electoral processes are making their authoritarian counterparts look rather virtuous in comparison. An unfair comparison, perhaps, as they won&#039;t have to continuously lie about the&nbsp;outcome of the election the way former US president Donald Trump and his followers have done.<br /><br />On a positive note, the Biden administration&#039;s national security strategy is certainly more comprehensive than the interim strategy that was released in March last year, which notably upset its allies,&nbsp;including Thailand.<br /><br />The present form retains the same substance and arguments -- Washington will continue to assign importance to the Indo-Pacific region, where it needs cooperation from allies and partners to rein China&#039;s&nbsp;influence in the region.<br /><br />The strategy reads: &#039;The terms of geopolitical competition between major powers will be set. The window of opportunity to deal with shared threats, like climate change, will narrow drastically. The actions we take now will shape whether this period is known as an age of conflict and discord or the beginning of a more stable and prosperous future.&#039;<br /><br />It further adds that the post-Cold War era is definitely over and that competition between major powers is underway to shape what comes next, even as people globally struggle to cope with the effects of&nbsp;shared challenges -- be it the climate, food insecurity, disease, terrorism, energy, or inflation.<br /><br />Under the strategy, the US will invest in ways to boost American power and influence, build up a coalition of allies to tackle common challenges such as climate change and modern warfare, as well as set&nbsp;up rules and regulations for trade, economic and new technologies. These are great ideas if they can be implemented in time, but countries in the region are all too aware of how difficult it is to&nbsp;meet the US&#039; criteria for such projects. Other East Asian partners are more forthcoming than the US.<br /><br />Washington&#039;s strategy identifies China as the only power with the intent and capability to reshape the international order. So, according to the Americans, the US must win over China by all means necessary. Never mind Russia -- with the ongoing war in Ukraine, its economic and military strength are severely weakened. It will take a long time before Russia could pose a credible threat to the US or Europe.<br /><br />The US security mindset is quite simple: &#039;I win, you lose&#039;. China often stresses the so-called &#039;win-win&#039; formula as the preferred model for cooperation. But the US and China cannot both be winners.<br /><br />In the past few months, Beijing has expounded &#039;shared prosperity&#039; as a novel social goal. To compete with China in the Indo-Pacific region, the US will face an uphill task because China has long embedded&nbsp;itself in the region in many areas of cooperation. Of course, some countries have stronger economic, cultural, and security ties with the US than others, that said, all have ties with China. The US strategy&nbsp;is very clear, stating that Beijing has &#039;ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world&#039;s leading power&#039;.<br /><br />The appropriate way for the US to engage with China is not to gang up with its friends against the region&#039;s most important trading partner. Washington wrongly assumed that this would be an effective way&nbsp;to suppress China&#039;s growth and influence in the region -- a by-product of Cold War thinking. It would serve the US and the region&#039;s strategic interests if Washington could strengthen its Indo-Pacific&nbsp;allies so they could engage in a more equal manner with China. Beijing would also welcome such a partnership.<br /><br />Most countries in the region have extensive ties with China, so any disruption to their bilateral dealings will have serious long-term negative effects on their economies as well as their people. Therefore,&nbsp;it is better for the US to focus on capacity building and human resource development, through projects which are tailored to each country&#039;s needs. Once their people have a better standard of living and&nbsp;greater aspirations, they would want to live in a free and open society.<br /><br />Therefore, it is safe to say that the US should let its allies in the Indo-Pacific to draw up their plans for the region at their own comfortable pace without any prejudice. A locally-oriented strategy&nbsp;will certainly be more effective.<br /><br />Like it or not, Thailand, although it was mentioned only once in the document, is part and parcel of the US strategy in the Indo-Pacific. As one of the five members of US treaty alliances along with Japan,&nbsp;South Korea, the Philippines and Australia, Thailand will eventually have to contribute to building up collective security and capacity in the region as outlined in the strategy.</p><p><em>This opinion piece was written by ERIA&#039;s Senior Communications Advisor, Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, and has been published in <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2416710/us-plans-for-indo-pacific-misguided" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bangkok Post</a>.&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:63:"/uploads/news/20221018/jonathan-simcoe-s9j1hqol9ns-unsplash.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:17077:"US plans for Indo-Pacific 'misguided' US plans for Indo-Pacific 'misguided' By Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, Senior Communications Advisor:&nbsp;To ensure a free, open, prosperous, and secure world, the United States must be the winner in the race for global supremacy.

An unfair comparison, perhaps, as they won't have to continuously lie about the&nbsp;outcome of the election the way former US president Donald Trump and his followers have done.On a positive note, the Biden administration's national security strategy is certainly more comprehensive than the interim strategy that was released in March last year, which notably upset its allies,&nbsp;including Thailand.The present form retains the same substance and arguments -- Washington will continue to assign importance to the Indo-Pacific region, where it needs cooperation from allies and partners to rein China's&nbsp;influence in the region.The strategy reads: 'The terms of geopolitical competition between major powers will be set. The window of opportunity to deal with shared threats, like climate change, will narrow drastically. The actions we take now will shape whether this period is known as an age of conflict and discord or the beginning of a more stable and prosperous future.'It further adds that the post-Cold War era is definitely over and that competition between major powers is underway to shape what comes next, even as people globally struggle to cope with the effects of&nbsp;shared challenges -- be it the climate, food insecurity, disease, terrorism, energy, or inflation.Under the strategy, the US will invest in ways to boost American power and influence, build up a coalition of allies to tackle common challenges such as climate change and modern warfare, as well as set&nbsp;up rules and regulations for trade, economic and new technologies. These are great ideas if they can be implemented in time, but countries in the region are all too aware of how difficult it is to&nbsp;meet the US' criteria for such projects. Other East Asian partners are more forthcoming than the US.Washington's strategy identifies China as the only power with the intent and capability to reshape the international order. So, according to the Americans, the US must win over China by all means necessary. Never mind Russia -- with the ongoing war in Ukraine, its economic and military strength are severely weakened. It will take a long time before Russia could pose a credible threat to the US or Europe.The US security mindset is quite simple: 'I win, you lose'. China often stresses the so-called 'win-win' formula as the preferred model for cooperation. But the US and China cannot both be winners.In the past few months, Beijing has expounded 'shared prosperity' as a novel social goal. To compete with China in the Indo-Pacific region, the US will face an uphill task because China has long embedded&nbsp;itself in the region in many areas of cooperation. Of course, some countries have stronger economic, cultural, and security ties with the US than others, that said, all have ties with China. The US strategy&nbsp;is very clear, stating that Beijing has 'ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world's leading power'.The appropriate way for the US to engage with China is not to gang up with its friends against the region's most important trading partner. Washington wrongly assumed that this would be an effective way&nbsp;to suppress China's growth and influence in the region -- a by-product of Cold War thinking. It would serve the US and the region's strategic interests if Washington could strengthen its Indo-Pacific&nbsp;allies so they could engage in a more equal manner with China. Beijing would also welcome such a partnership.Most countries in the region have extensive ties with China, so any disruption to their bilateral dealings will have serious long-term negative effects on their economies as well as their people. Therefore,&nbsp;it is better for the US to focus on capacity building and human resource development, through projects which are tailored to each country's needs. Once their people have a better standard of living and&nbsp;greater aspirations, they would want to live in a free and open society.Therefore, it is safe to say that the US should let its allies in the Indo-Pacific to draw up their plans for the region at their own comfortable pace without any prejudice. A locally-oriented strategy&nbsp;will certainly be more effective.Like it or not, Thailand, although it was mentioned only once in the document, is part and parcel of the US strategy in the Indo-Pacific. As one of the five members of US treaty alliances along with Japan,&nbsp;South Korea, the Philippines and Australia, Thailand will eventually have to contribute to building up collective security and capacity in the region as outlined in the strategy.

Those frameworks also acknowledge and support&nbsp;the Asean centrality as a key component for future cooperation within the AOIP.<br /><br />The AOIP has four key priority areas: maritime cooperation, connectivity, SDGs and economic and other possible areas of cooperation. The Asean Secretariat has been compiling lists of projects between Asean and its dialogue parties that can be synergised with the AOIP&#039;s four priorities.</p><p>At the recent annual Asean meeting in Phnom Penh, the foreign ministers reaffirmed the AOIP as a guide for the bloc&#039;s engagement&nbsp;in the wider Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. In addition, they also agreed that all Asean-led mechanisms continue to serve as useful platforms for dialogue and cooperation to implement the AOIP.</p><p>That&nbsp;explains why the bloc has retained the geographical location of Indo-Pacific, as popularly used by the West, but with a different interpretation. Asean views the two continents as one, with Asean at the centre.</p><p>Among the bloc&#039;s dialogue partners, Japan has an early start. Since 2020 Japan has been able to synergise its Free and Open Indo-Pacific with the AOIP with a total of 64 projects covering all four priority&nbsp;areas outlined by the AOIP. Prior to 2020, Japan made several revisions to its Indo-Pacific strategies to gain support from all Asean members.<br /><br />In earlier versions, Japan did not place Asean as its strategic centre. Further consultations between the two sides resulted in the current version that has been welcomed by Asean. At the 23rd Asean-Japan&nbsp;Summit, both sides then agreed to issue a joint statement on Cooperation on AOIP and Japan.<br /><br />India has been trying to align its Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) with the AOIP. But Delhi&#039;s IPOI is zeroing in on maritime domain-related efforts such as management, conservation, and sustainability of marine resources.</p><p>Unlike the US strategies, which focus on values and strategic interests, the AOIP is geared toward functional cooperation that would promote openness and inclusivity. In other words, it is not aimed at&nbsp;other third countries.</p><p>At the upcoming Asean summit, the bloc&#039;s leader will rubber-stamp the concept paper that will detail methods and mechanisms to mainstream and enhance the implementation of the four&nbsp;priority areas of the AOIP. Asean is confident that its outlook will garner support from external partners that will lead to more practical and closer cooperation in the years to come.<br /><br />One of the mainstreaming efforts would be to identify a lead driver who will then implement agreed areas by the Asean members. The driver could be added later depending on interested Asean members and&nbsp;their dialogue partners. This would avoid any overlapping timelines and redundancies with other regional and inter-regional programmes such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation schemes.</p><p>In addition, more engagement with track 1.5 and track 2 would be encouraged to obtain new ideas for implementing the AOIP. For instance, the expanded Asean Maritime Forum would be ideal for such an undertaking.</p><p>Obviously, one of the premier Asean-led mechanisms would be the East Asia Summit (EAS) as all the&nbsp; world&#039;s major powers are members of this summit. Since 2005, the leaders-only forum has been meeting annually to exchange views on strategic, political, and economic issues within East Asia.</p><p>The EAS brings together leaders from Asean&#039;s 10 member states with those of Australia, China, India, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, the US and Russia.</p><p><em>This opinion piece was written by ERIA&#039;s Senior Communications Advisor, Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, and has been published in <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2427000/its-time-to-mainstream-the-aoip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bangkok Post</a>.&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:37:"/uploads/news/20221101/aseanflags.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:15187:"It's time to mainstream the AOIP It's time to mainstream the AOIP By Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, Senior Communications Advisor:&nbsp;One of the top priorities that the Asean leaders have to vet and approve at the Asean-related summit on Nov 11 is the plan to operationalise the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP).
Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February, the global security landscape has dramatically changed, affecting the grouping's external relations.
As a fulcrum, Asean still possesses both the convening and convincing power that can accommodate the superpowers' cooperative and confrontational modes.In the coming days, the region will be under the global microscope; in particular Phnom Penh, Bali and Bangkok. They want to know how the latest geopolitical brinksmanship is being played out over here.
When the idea of having a new regional architecture for multi-faceted cooperation that would respond to the new geopolitical and geo-economic environment was raised back in 2017, Asean's senior&nbsp; officials&nbsp;and national committees thought it would not be possible to come out with such a framework as key powers had already announced their strategies to ensure an enduring presence and engagement in the region.It took the determination of Indonesia, which initially wanted to go alone in this endeavour and was later joined by Thailand, the 2019 Asean chair, to pick up the agenda and push hard. The outcome was&nbsp;the region's first assessment of the Indo-Pacific.
The AOIP, which was announced in Bangkok, marked a new phase of the bloc's centrality and neutrality. After a year of tense consultation among the members,&nbsp;the AOIP was born.
Today it is considered one of the most prominent documents in the bloc's 55-year-old history, on par with the grouping's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (1976), the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (1995) and Zone of Peace, Freedom, and Neutrality (1971). After a three-year hiatus due to the pandemic, the time has now come for Asean to operationalise the&nbsp;the AOIP.
When President Donald Trump proposed the Free and Open Indo-Pacific during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders' meeting in Danang in 2017, Asean was caught unprepared and was&nbsp;not able to respond collectively as not all Asean members were Apec members.
However, with Mr Trump's America First policy as the lightning rod, Asean knew immediately that it was imperative to formulate&nbsp;its own Indo-Pacific plan. Discussions at the initial stage were tense and unyielding as some key Asean members viewed the idea as a futile attempt to challenge the superpower's overarching global strategies. These members perceived the US security role in Indo-Pacific as indispensable, and nothing should be done to temper or loosen Washington's engagement.But Mr Trump's inward-looking policy helped to unite Asean's divergent views of the future US trajectory in the region. The choice was clear -- it would be either the Asean plan which the 10-member group&nbsp;put together or Asean could comply with competing strategic frameworks imposed by outside powers.At the moment, besides the AOIP, at least eight different Indo-Pacific ideas are at play, namely those of the US, Japan, EU, India, Japan, Australia, France and Germany. South Korea is also planning to&nbsp;release its version of the Indo-Pacific strategy later this year, which will highlight the role of Asean.All recognise the importance of this vast region covering the whole of East Asia across Southeast and South Asia and reaching the coastline of East Africa. Those frameworks also acknowledge and support&nbsp;the Asean centrality as a key component for future cooperation within the AOIP.The AOIP has four key priority areas: maritime cooperation, connectivity, SDGs and economic and other possible areas of cooperation. The Asean Secretariat has been compiling lists of projects between Asean and its dialogue parties that can be synergised with the AOIP's four priorities.
At the recent annual Asean meeting in Phnom Penh, the foreign ministers reaffirmed the AOIP as a guide for the bloc's engagement&nbsp;in the wider Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. In addition, they also agreed that all Asean-led mechanisms continue to serve as useful platforms for dialogue and cooperation to implement the AOIP.
That&nbsp;explains why the bloc has retained the geographical location of Indo-Pacific, as popularly used by the West, but with a different interpretation. Asean views the two continents as one, with Asean at the centre.
Among the bloc's dialogue partners, Japan has an early start. Since 2020 Japan has been able to synergise its Free and Open Indo-Pacific with the AOIP with a total of 64 projects covering all four priority&nbsp;areas outlined by the AOIP. Prior to 2020, Japan made several revisions to its Indo-Pacific strategies to gain support from all Asean members.In earlier versions, Japan did not place Asean as its strategic centre. Further consultations between the two sides resulted in the current version that has been welcomed by Asean. At the 23rd Asean-Japan&nbsp;Summit, both sides then agreed to issue a joint statement on Cooperation on AOIP and Japan.India has been trying to align its Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) with the AOIP. But Delhi's IPOI is zeroing in on maritime domain-related efforts such as management, conservation, and sustainability of marine resources.
Unlike the US strategies, which focus on values and strategic interests, the AOIP is geared toward functional cooperation that would promote openness and inclusivity. In other words, it is not aimed at&nbsp;other third countries.
At the upcoming Asean summit, the bloc's leader will rubber-stamp the concept paper that will detail methods and mechanisms to mainstream and enhance the implementation of the four&nbsp;priority areas of the AOIP. Asean is confident that its outlook will garner support from external partners that will lead to more practical and closer cooperation in the years to come.One of the mainstreaming efforts would be to identify a lead driver who will then implement agreed areas by the Asean members. The driver could be added later depending on interested Asean members and&nbsp;their dialogue partners. This would avoid any overlapping timelines and redundancies with other regional and inter-regional programmes such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation schemes.
In addition, more engagement with track 1.5 and track 2 would be encouraged to obtain new ideas for implementing the AOIP. For instance, the expanded Asean Maritime Forum would be ideal for such an undertaking.
Obviously, one of the premier Asean-led mechanisms would be the East Asia Summit (EAS) as all the&nbsp; world's major powers are members of this summit. Since 2005, the leaders-only forum has been meeting annually to exchange views on strategic, political, and economic issues within East Asia.
The EAS brings together leaders from Asean's 10 member states with those of Australia, China, India, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, the US and Russia.

Transformative and collaborative inventions to drive sustainability in carbon-intensive sectors need to be prioritised. Whilst technology can hasten the transition towards a more sustainable and circular economy, sharing of technology and knowledge, combined with adequate funding, is needed. IP can help.
Eppinger et. al in 2021 consider IP rights as essential to enable innovation and diffusion of sustainable technologies, improve collaboration, and foster prosperity in developing countries.

The other 34 countries that took a similar stand were not in the news because they were expected to do precisely that.</p><div class="articl-content"><p>That helps explain why Thailand&#039;s international decision matters a lot -- something that its own citizens, friends, and allies have taken for granted. Although its abstention did not change the equation of the current conflict in Ukraine, it has more to do with Thailand&#039;s concern about the next chapter of the ongoing conflict impacting the economy and security of the rest of the world. In its explanation of the vote, it is clear that its positions and adherence to the UN charter and international laws have not changed. To comprehend the rationale of this landmark decision, Thailand&#039;s past diplomatic practices must be part of the consideration as it has preserved the country&#039;s national sovereignty from Western colonialists, which annexed parts of Thai territory. The decision was more than skin deep as it involved a combination of factors and circumstances -- immediate and long term as well as internal and external aspects. At least 10 reasons can be identified.</p><p>1. First of all, this is an extraordinary year for Thailand as it is commemorating its 75th year of ties with the UN, which Thailand joined after the end of World War II. It was a life-saving moment for the country, which was seeking international shelter for its post-war debilitated position. Throughout seven-and-a-half decades, Thailand has been a faithful member of the UN with an unwavering commitment to the UN charter. Its dedication to the UN has never been in question.</p><p>2. Throughout this year, Thailand has successfully reconnected with its UN counterparts by actively taking part in all UN-sponsored forums. In addition, the country also reaffirms its confidence in the multilateral system which is at the centre of the global development agenda. Lest we forget, since 2016, Thailand has been the coordinator for Asean and the UN on the sustainable development agenda. Both organisations have synergies in their sustainability goals.</p><p>3. Thailand&#039;s desire to reshape the global agenda is paramount and has been quite visible.

The other 34 countries that took a similar stand were not in the news because they were expected to do precisely that.

That helps explain why Thailand's international decision matters a lot -- something that its own citizens, friends, and allies have taken for granted. Although its abstention did not change the equation of the current conflict in Ukraine, it has more to do with Thailand's concern about the next chapter of the ongoing conflict impacting the economy and security of the rest of the world. In its explanation of the vote, it is clear that its positions and adherence to the UN charter and international laws have not changed. To comprehend the rationale of this landmark decision, Thailand's past diplomatic practices must be part of the consideration as it has preserved the country's national sovereignty from Western colonialists, which annexed parts of Thai territory. The decision was more than skin deep as it involved a combination of factors and circumstances -- immediate and long term as well as internal and external aspects. At least 10 reasons can be identified.
1. First of all, this is an extraordinary year for Thailand as it is commemorating its 75th year of ties with the UN, which Thailand joined after the end of World War II. It was a life-saving moment for the country, which was seeking international shelter for its post-war debilitated position. Throughout seven-and-a-half decades, Thailand has been a faithful member of the UN with an unwavering commitment to the UN charter. Its dedication to the UN has never been in question.
2. Throughout this year, Thailand has successfully reconnected with its UN counterparts by actively taking part in all UN-sponsored forums. In addition, the country also reaffirms its confidence in the multilateral system which is at the centre of the global development agenda. Lest we forget, since 2016, Thailand has been the coordinator for Asean and the UN on the sustainable development agenda. Both organisations have synergies in their sustainability goals.
3. Thailand's desire to reshape the global agenda is paramount and has been quite visible. As the chair of Apec 2022, the host has a grandiose plan to promote the new economic model known as the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG), which is very much in line with the UN sustainable development goals. Currently, senior officials are working on the substance of the Bangkok Goal on the BCG, which will contain the future action plans and aspirations of Apec cooperation in sustainable development.
4. On March 2, Thailand voted to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine along with the majority of UN members. It was a clear choice. However, since then, nearly nine months have elapsed without any progress in peaceful dialogue. In addition, Bangkok has been calling for humanitarian assistance to victims of the Russia-Ukraine war. Thailand also stands ready to help with the peace process if need be.
5. By abstaining from the vote on Oct 12, Bangkok has quickly become the talk of the global diplomatic circuit. Now its voice is being heard that the mad-mad world of war in Europe is a no-win situation. An off-ramp must be found that will bring a quick end to the war. In its 75-year history at the UN, Thailand would abstain from voting if the resolutions sounded "murky", otherwise its vote would always be a supportive one.
6. Thailand's position is clear regarding the current situation in Ukraine. The four-paragraph explanation of the vote pointed out that the vote took place during "an extremely volatile and emotionally charged atmosphere", which "marginalises the chance for crisis diplomacy to bring about a peaceful and practical negotiated resolution". Bangkok also fears that the current conflict may push the world toward the brink of nuclear war and global economic collapse.
7. Thailand's fear of nuclear Armageddon is genuine. This month 60 years ago the Cuban crisis nearly brought the world to the brink of such a calamity.

In the case of the Apec leaders' meeting, Vice President Kamala Harris is coming. The most important point that needs to be made is that nobody boycotts the Bangkok meeting.
9. In addition to the leaders of 22 economies in the Asia-Pacific, for the first time, French President Emmanuelle Macron and Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohamed bin Salman are attending Apec 2022 as guests of the chair.

Notwithstanding the current dynamics in the global economy, Dr Alexander Chandra noted key points to be focused on for promoting GRP include: mainstreaming GRP in different cooperation sectors in AEC, supported by appropriate Capacity Building activities to drive the reform; enabling good regulations to catch up with the rising opportunities and challenges in the region and; adopting agile regulations that value the economic and society.</p><p>Dr Intan Murnira Ramli, Policy Fellow of ERIA went on to present an overview of the ASEAN Handbook on GRP. She explained the four main chapters of the Handbook focus on the objectives of ASEAN GRP principles; methods in implementing GRP to foster a conducive regulatory environment; technical and applications for GRP and; elements to prepare the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). She concluded noting that most AMS is on track across the government sectors, yet continuous efforts to cut red tape, introduce sunset clauses, provide stakeholder consultation platforms, and thorough monitoring and evaluations are required.</p><p>The Handbook overview was followed by an exchange of best practices across AMS by three experts. Dr Gilberto M. Lianto, President of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), shared the elements of formal Regulatory Management Systems (RMS) covering regulatory policies, regulatory institutions, regulatory procedures, and regulatory tools. Ms Shahriza Bahari, Deputy Director at Malaysia Productivity Corporation (MPC) explained the role of MPC as a government ad-hoc agency including to promote the GRP across public-private institutions, evaluate the feedback from the businesses and citizens, quality assurance for the policy, and technical advice for the officials. Ms Eunice Huang, Head of Asia-Pacific Trade Policy at Google shared information about digital good regulatory practices covering internal and external stakeholders&rsquo; engagement, interoperability to adopt international standard frameworks, and ability to develop more adaptive regulatory frameworks. The presentation, followed by questions and answers, was moderated by Dr Rashesh Shrestha.</p><p>After the discussion, Dr Intan Murnira Ramli outlined key recommendations to embrace GRP principles in the national bureaucracy of AMS. These included: increasing capacity building of GRP and RMS implementation; strengthening existing institutional frameworks on GRP; enhancing public-private partnerships and; strengthening the capacity of RIA.</p><p>Jeremy Gross, ERIA Director of Capacity Building, closed the event by thanking the experts for sharing their insights and reiterated ERIA&rsquo;s commitment to mainstreaming the GRP across the ASEAN region in collaboration with the ASEAN Secretariat. He also noted his optimism and the momentum for pushing GRP forward across the region noting the number of people joining the morning&rsquo;s seminar. ERIA&rsquo;s Capacity Building Program has long been active to support efforts at GRP and RMS in the region.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:93:"/uploads/news/20221017/2022_oct_good-regulatory-practices-why-it-matters-to-asean_800x450.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:8273:"Good Regulatory Practices: Why It Matters to ASEAN?

Notwithstanding the current dynamics in the global economy, Dr Alexander Chandra noted key points to be focused on for promoting GRP include: mainstreaming GRP in different cooperation sectors in AEC, supported by appropriate Capacity Building activities to drive the reform; enabling good regulations to catch up with the rising opportunities and challenges in the region and; adopting agile regulations that value the economic and society.
Dr Intan Murnira Ramli, Policy Fellow of ERIA went on to present an overview of the ASEAN Handbook on GRP. She explained the four main chapters of the Handbook focus on the objectives of ASEAN GRP principles; methods in implementing GRP to foster a conducive regulatory environment; technical and applications for GRP and; elements to prepare the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). She concluded noting that most AMS is on track across the government sectors, yet continuous efforts to cut red tape, introduce sunset clauses, provide stakeholder consultation platforms, and thorough monitoring and evaluations are required.
The Handbook overview was followed by an exchange of best practices across AMS by three experts. Dr Gilberto M. Lianto, President of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), shared the elements of formal Regulatory Management Systems (RMS) covering regulatory policies, regulatory institutions, regulatory procedures, and regulatory tools. Ms Shahriza Bahari, Deputy Director at Malaysia Productivity Corporation (MPC) explained the role of MPC as a government ad-hoc agency including to promote the GRP across public-private institutions, evaluate the feedback from the businesses and citizens, quality assurance for the policy, and technical advice for the officials. Ms Eunice Huang, Head of Asia-Pacific Trade Policy at Google shared information about digital good regulatory practices covering internal and external stakeholders&rsquo; engagement, interoperability to adopt international standard frameworks, and ability to develop more adaptive regulatory frameworks. The presentation, followed by questions and answers, was moderated by Dr Rashesh Shrestha.
After the discussion, Dr Intan Murnira Ramli outlined key recommendations to embrace GRP principles in the national bureaucracy of AMS. These included: increasing capacity building of GRP and RMS implementation; strengthening existing institutional frameworks on GRP; enhancing public-private partnerships and; strengthening the capacity of RIA.
Jeremy Gross, ERIA Director of Capacity Building, closed the event by thanking the experts for sharing their insights and reiterated ERIA&rsquo;s commitment to mainstreaming the GRP across the ASEAN region in collaboration with the ASEAN Secretariat. He also noted his optimism and the momentum for pushing GRP forward across the region noting the number of people joining the morning&rsquo;s seminar. ERIA&rsquo;s Capacity Building Program has long been active to support efforts at GRP and RMS in the region.             2022-10-17 17 October 2022 2202 rebotcO 71 71-01-2202             .noiger eht ni SMR dna PRG ta stroffe troppus ot evitca neeb gnol sah margorP gnidliuB yticapaC s;ouqsr&AIRE .ranimes s;ouqsr&gninrom eht gninioj elpoep fo rebmun eht gniton noiger eht ssorca drawrof PRG gnihsup rof mutnemom eht dna msimitpo sih deton osla eH .tairaterceS NAESA eht htiw noitaroballoc ni noiger NAESA eht ssorca PRG eht gnimaertsniam ot tnemtimmoc s;ouqsr&AIRE detaretier dna sthgisni rieht gnirahs rof strepxe eht gniknaht yb tneve eht desolc ,gnidliuB yticapaC fo rotceriD AIRE ,ssorG ymereJ

&nbsp;
With the theme of&nbsp;Enhancing Connectivity Towards an Inclusive, Sustainable and Resilient ASEAN Community Post 2025 Vision,&nbsp;the Symposium engaged panellists from various backgrounds, from governments and think tanks to consulting firms and multinational development banks.

In his keynote address, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Cambodia, Prak Sokhonn emphasised the critical role of connectivity in supporting recovery efforts and building resilience, particularly on the region&rsquo;s supply chain, and stronger partnerships with broader stakeholders.
'The future of our region will depend on our regional competitiveness, which can only come from a well-connected region that acts in unison,' he stressed. &nbsp;As ASEAN, the approach is all about getting the maximum synergy from these initiatives, the so-called 'Connecting the Connectivities' approach to extract the necessary added value.
He further reminded that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership has just entered into force this year. This mega free trade will drive ASEAN&rsquo;s regional economy to greater heights. There is a need to align the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC) 2025 so that it can act as the nexus linking various strategies and initiatives in the region to support for that matter our inclusive, sustainable, and resilient ASEAN.
Secretary-General of ASEAN Dato Lim Jock Hoi highlighted the need for ASEAN to be resilient, adaptable, and responsive to ever-changing needs. 'While we continue to plan for the future, we need to build a dynamic link between thinking about the future and taking actions in the present,' he added.&nbsp; He further shared that ASEAN must work with all partners in the short-, medium-, and long-term, and demonstrate that the resources they invested in the region will benefit them as much as it benefits ASEAN.
Against the backdrop of post-pandemic recovery, the Symposium exchanged views on current issues and emerging trends as well as challenges ASEAN encounters in developing an ASEAN Connectivity Post 2025 Agenda.
It also discussed ways to strengthen partnerships on ASEAN Connectivity with various stakeholders, and how sustainable infrastructure, smart cities development, and digital innovation can shape and enhance the evolving regional network, contributing towards building an inclusive, resilient and well-connected ASEAN Community.
The President of ERIA Professor Hidetoshi Nishimura, in his remarks, accentuated the importance of digital connection in the implementation of MPAC 2025. He made a reference to ERIA&rsquo;s work on the Comprehensive Asia Development Plan 3.0, which highlights strategies for establishing a more integrated, innovative, inclusive and sustainable economy in ASEAN and East Asia by promoting physical and digital connectivity in the region.&nbsp; 'I am highly confident that this CADP 3.0 will contribute to deepening ASEAN&rsquo;s connectivity beyond 2025,' he said.
The ASEAN Connectivity Symposium is an annual flagship event inaugurated in 2010, and it continues to serve as a platform to engage stakeholders to identify potential areas of cooperation to enhance the implementation of MPAC 2025 and the wider ASEAN Connectivity agenda.

The conference discussed a wide range of sectors, from government to business, to address the challenges of global economy and how to navigate our economy in the mid of those challenges.</p><p>The Summit was opened by the President of Republic of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, and attended by several ministers and high-level speakers: Mr Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Coordinating Minister of Maritime and Investment Affairs of Indonesia; Mr Airlangga Hartarto, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs of Indonesia; Mr Erick Thohir, Minister of State Owned Enterprises of Indonesia; Dr Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Minister of Finance of Indonesia; Mr Mahendra Siregar, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia; and Mr Bahlil Lahadalia, Minister of Investment of Indonesia. The first session highlighted Indonesia&rsquo;s Strategy to face Global Uncertainty.</p><p>Dr Lili Yan Ing, ERIA&rsquo;s Lead Advisor for Southeast Asia Region, chaired the first session on the Global Economic Outlook, with high-level speakers: Professor Kenneth Rogoff, Professor of Economics at Harvard University; Professor Justin Yifu Lin, Founding Director of China Center for Economic Research; Professor Jayati Ghosh, Professor of Economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University; and Dr Chatib Basri, Chairman of PT Bank Mandiri.</p><p>The Global Economic Outlook session discussed the current global economic situation, especially in major economies, and the impact of current geopolitical tensions on the global economic outlook. Global economic growth stalled in the second quarter of 2022. The prolonged US-China economic and technology&nbsp;tensions, the war in Ukraine, food and energy driven inflation, tight monetary policies around the globe, and the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated long- standing issues of rising inequality and climate change, creating unprecedented challenges for Indonesia&rsquo;s economic outlook. Inflation in the OECD countries might rise further reaching more than 9%. Tightening monetary policy also drives the slowing world economic growth due to greater-than-expected overshoot of inflation targets. Now the main concern of all countries is how to raise optimism despite uncertainty for the future, including Indonesia&rsquo;s economic outlook.</p><p>During the session, on Indonesian economy, Dr Ing stated that <em>&lsquo;Indonesia does not have any privilege in fiscal, we do not have high ratios of tax revenue to GDP, the ratio of our tax revenue to GDP only ranged between 8-9% in 2019.&rsquo;</em> Indonesia needs to maintain its tax revenue, particularly during the recovery phase from COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the limited fiscal space of Indonesia, Dr Ing assessed that <em>&lsquo;the good thing about the Indonesian economy is that we have prudent fiscal policy. By law, we need to maintain the fiscal deficit at 3% of GDP, during the pandemic, we relaxed it to 6%, but next year, Indonesia aims to have it back to only 2.9% of GDP.&rsquo;</em> According to Indonesia&rsquo;s State Revenue and Expenditure Plan for 2023, the Ministry of Finance has targeted a fiscal deficit of 2.8% of GDP in 2023 as an effort for the country to maintain its fiscal stability.</p><p>Dr Ing also stated that&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;one thing we should pay more attention to is on our trade and investment. On trade, it is true that Indonesia&rsquo;s trade recorded trade surpluses of USD16 and USD32 billion&nbsp;consecutively&nbsp;in 2020 and 2021 and estimated to record USD44 billion this year.&nbsp;</em><em>First, the increase was due to increase in commodity prices, not with our export performance (neither value added in exports). The volume of our exports indeed declined by 50 million tons in 2020 and 169 million tons in this year alone. Second, there has been decreasing in imports of machinery and raw materials or inputs. On investment, just in this semester, developing countries recorded capital outflows of USD50 billion in responding to increased interest rates in developed countries. Indonesia cannot just do business as usual; Indonesia should take serious actions to improve exports and maintain investment as those are key to maintain employment and purchasing power, particularly working-class society.&rsquo;</em></p><p>Dr Ing offered suggestions for Indonesia to increase its revenue, <em>&lsquo;First, increase export levies on sectors that have been advantaged by windfall in energy and commodity prices (Palm and Coal) and second increase custom and tax on cigarettes and luxury goods (private jet, yacht, cars, and others).&rsquo;</em> As a closing remark, Dr Ing highlighted <em>&lsquo;Well it is good for business to be optimistic, but it is crucial for the government to be realistic and credible. The Indonesian government should take into account the worst scenarios and how the government will respond to that situation.&rsquo;</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:87:"/uploads/news/20221011/2022_oct_press-release-investor-daily-summit-2022_800x450-1.jpeg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:10207:"How Can Indonesia Manage Uncertainties?

Dr Lili Yan Ing, ERIA&rsquo;s Lead Advisor for Southeast Asia Region, chaired the first session on the Global Economic Outlook, with high-level speakers: Professor Kenneth Rogoff, Professor of Economics at Harvard University; Professor Justin Yifu Lin, Founding Director of China Center for Economic Research; Professor Jayati Ghosh, Professor of Economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University; and Dr Chatib Basri, Chairman of PT Bank Mandiri.
The Global Economic Outlook session discussed the current global economic situation, especially in major economies, and the impact of current geopolitical tensions on the global economic outlook. Global economic growth stalled in the second quarter of 2022. The prolonged US-China economic and technology&nbsp;tensions, the war in Ukraine, food and energy driven inflation, tight monetary policies around the globe, and the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated long- standing issues of rising inequality and climate change, creating unprecedented challenges for Indonesia&rsquo;s economic outlook. Inflation in the OECD countries might rise further reaching more than 9%. Tightening monetary policy also drives the slowing world economic growth due to greater-than-expected overshoot of inflation targets. Now the main concern of all countries is how to raise optimism despite uncertainty for the future, including Indonesia&rsquo;s economic outlook.
During the session, on Indonesian economy, Dr Ing stated that &lsquo;Indonesia does not have any privilege in fiscal, we do not have high ratios of tax revenue to GDP, the ratio of our tax revenue to GDP only ranged between 8-9% in 2019.&rsquo; Indonesia needs to maintain its tax revenue, particularly during the recovery phase from COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the limited fiscal space of Indonesia, Dr Ing assessed that &lsquo;the good thing about the Indonesian economy is that we have prudent fiscal policy. By law, we need to maintain the fiscal deficit at 3% of GDP, during the pandemic, we relaxed it to 6%, but next year, Indonesia aims to have it back to only 2.9% of GDP.&rsquo; According to Indonesia&rsquo;s State Revenue and Expenditure Plan for 2023, the Ministry of Finance has targeted a fiscal deficit of 2.8% of GDP in 2023 as an effort for the country to maintain its fiscal stability.
Dr Ing also stated that&nbsp;&lsquo;one thing we should pay more attention to is on our trade and investment. On trade, it is true that Indonesia&rsquo;s trade recorded trade surpluses of USD16 and USD32 billion&nbsp;consecutively&nbsp;in 2020 and 2021 and estimated to record USD44 billion this year.&nbsp;First, the increase was due to increase in commodity prices, not with our export performance (neither value added in exports). The volume of our exports indeed declined by 50 million tons in 2020 and 169 million tons in this year alone. Second, there has been decreasing in imports of machinery and raw materials or inputs. On investment, just in this semester, developing countries recorded capital outflows of USD50 billion in responding to increased interest rates in developed countries. Indonesia cannot just do business as usual; Indonesia should take serious actions to improve exports and maintain investment as those are key to maintain employment and purchasing power, particularly working-class society.&rsquo;
Dr Ing offered suggestions for Indonesia to increase its revenue, &lsquo;First, increase export levies on sectors that have been advantaged by windfall in energy and commodity prices (Palm and Coal) and second increase custom and tax on cigarettes and luxury goods (private jet, yacht, cars, and others).&rsquo; As a closing remark, Dr Ing highlighted &lsquo;Well it is good for business to be optimistic, but it is crucial for the government to be realistic and credible. The Indonesian government should take into account the worst scenarios and how the government will respond to that situation.&rsquo;             2022-10-11 11 October 2022 2202 rebotcO 11 11-01-2202             ;ouqsr&.noitautis taht ot dnopser lliw tnemnrevog eht woh dna soiranecs tsrow eht tnuocca otni ekat dluohs tnemnrevog naisenodnI ehT .elbiderc dna citsilaer eb ot tnemnrevog eht rof laicurc si ti tub ,citsimitpo eb ot ssenisub rof doog si ti lleW;ouqsl& dethgilhgih gnI rD ,kramer gnisolc a sA ;ouqsr&.)srehto dna ,srac ,thcay ,tej etavirp( sdoog yruxul dna setteragic no xat dna motsuc esaercni dnoces dna )laoC dna mlaP( secirp ytidommoc dna ygrene ni llafdniw yb degatnavda neeb evah taht srotces no seivel tropxe esaercni ,tsriF;ouqsl& ,eunever sti esaercni ot aisenodnI rof snoitseggus dereffo gnI rD

The Asian market and labour forces have evolved rapidly due to augmented technology innovation. Technological advancement has contributed to the increased level of market productivity, <a href="/publications/entrepreneurship-start-ups-and-innovation-e-s-i-in-asean-and-east-asia-catalysing-collaborations-and-partnerships-for-scale-ups-ep6-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new job creation, and digitally enabled entrepreneurship</a>. However, automation risk is inevitable, resulting in replacement of traditional jobs and demand for new skills.

Speakers made the following points. The Asian market and labour forces have evolved rapidly due to augmented technology innovation. Technological advancement has contributed to the increased level of market productivity, new job creation, and digitally enabled entrepreneurship. However, automation risk is inevitable, resulting in replacement of traditional jobs and demand for new skills. Shifts in skills demand might harm vulnerable groups, including women, people in rural areas, and people with disabilities. Policymakers need to address skills shortages and gaps by ensuring equitable and equal access for workers and employers to reskilling and upskilling. Therefore, a set of policy agendas with a multi-stakeholder approach to establish an inclusive and conducive ecosystem is required to prepare a future-ready workforce.
The conference had four sessions.
Session 1: Enhancing Innovation in Rural Areas
In her opening remarks, Anne Lochoff, Programme Director of Singapore Agri-Food Innovation Lab at Nanyang Technological University Degree, highlighted the importance of the digital dimension, innovation for future competitiveness, and sustainability in enhancing productivity in rural areas. She said innovation improves connectivity and generates mutual benefits between urban and rural areas. She added that universal basic needs are some of the primary factors that often drive rural innovation.
Chimka Mukhbayar, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Nomads Agritech Innovations &nbsp;(Mongolia), identified the main challenges for local farmers who want to innovate: access to information, finance, and market. She reported that she had developed a digital application to help farmers obtain information more easily, advance production, and commercialise business. She added that training in digital skills and literacy is required to optimise the benefits of information and communication technology innovation in rural areas.
Saran Song, CEO of Amru Rice Co. Ltd. (Cambodia), said it is important to apply inclusive business models that incorporate social protection for rural farmers.

Session 2: Technology Disruption and the Future of Jobs
In his opening remarks, Bob Aubrey, Founder and Chair of the Advisory Board of the ASEAN Human Development Organisation, noted the current trend of workers, especially Gen Z, not wanting to be treated as capital but as human beings. To build a sustainable workforce, he said net positive principles are important to allow organisations to embrace innovation by investing in a people-centric, purpose-driven culture, and an environmental, social, and governance approach.

Session 3: Managing Disability in the Workplace
Stefan Tromel, Senior Disability Specialist at the International Labour Organization, said that fostering more people with disability (PWDs) at work would be a game changer in changing society&rsquo;s mindset about them. With the shifting demand for skills in the workforce, he said, PWDs&rsquo; career development must be ensured. He emphasised the importance of riding the waves of change to eliminate physical and mental barriers.
Made Wikandana, Disability Inclusion Officer of the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund, Indonesia, stated that the biggest barrier for PWDs in the workforce is stigma and prejudice. They are often the first to be fired and the last to be hired. He stressed that PWDs must have growth mindset to keep pace with the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), in cooperation with the Deutsche Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the Indonesian Research Institute for Decarbonzation (IRID), and the Global Solutions Initiative (GSI), organised a hybrid workshop on Circular Economy for a Stronger Recovery: A Just Transition Agenda for G20.
The workshop discussed the innovative and context-sensitive technologies in support of circular economy; the transfer, uptake, and scaling of the use of technology together with adequate public financial mechanisms; and mobilisation of private capital, which are fundamental in ensuring a transformative, inclusive, and sustainable recovery.

The meeting addressed the importance of a balanced energy transition for achieving sustainable economic growth, mitigating climate change, and ensuring energy security in the context of a global energy situation that is undergoing a radical transformation. The meeting discussed the steady progress of numerous public and private sector efforts based on the Asian Energy Transition Initiative (AETI) announced last year, as well as new support measures and projects to expedite it.
The meeting was opened by H.E. Mr Nishimura Yasutoshi, Japan&rsquo;s Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry, followed by a speech from Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Representatives from Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Canada, Indonesia, Iran, Lao People&rsquo;s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Viet Nam, the ASEAN Economic Community, and the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) reported on their efforts to speed up an inclusive energy transition and heighten the role of international cooperation to achieve this goal under the pillars of energy security, energy development, and affordable access of energy whilst addressing climate change challenges.
Prof Hidetoshi Nishimura, President of ERIA, shared ERIA&rsquo;s perspective on ASEAN&rsquo;s carbon neutrality challenges. He cited the institute&rsquo;s research on a cost-optimal technology deployment scenario to achieve carbon neutrality in the ASEAN region by 2060. Prof Nishimura reported on Cambodia and ERIA&rsquo;s co-hosting of the 5th East Asia Energy Forum on ASEAN&rsquo;s Challenges on Carbon Neutrality and Energy Security, which discussed issues relevant to current energy and climate challenges, including the role of natural gas, energy transition pathways, and the financing scheme for the transition.
Transition finance guidelines, technology lists, and perspectives on transition finance, as well as financial activities and policies in line with AETI and Asia Transition Finance (ATF) were discussed in the first session. Through AETI in 2021 and the notion of the Asia Zero Emissions Community, Japan&rsquo;s government is seeking to contribute to the region's transition to a more sustainable economic model and carbon neutrality. Prof Nishimura of ERIA highlighted decarbonisation pathways to achieve the Glasgow Climate Pact and the Paris Agreement. He reported that ERIA has developed Technology List and Perspectives for Transition Finance in Asia in collaboration with the ATF Study Group. The document, he said, provides a framework for evaluating a potential transition technology as well as factual information on a variety of potential transition technologies.
During the second session, a memorandum of understanding was signed for the projects that contribute to Asian energy transition. Remarks followed from H.E. Ms Ota Fusae, Japan&rsquo;s State Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry. Special messages were delivered by Mr Asakawa Masatsugu, President of the Asian Development Bank; Mr Paul Everingham, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Asia Natural Gas and Energy Association, Singapore; Mr Jaideep Khanna, Head of Barclays, Asia Pacific; Mr Nadir Godrej, Chairman of Godrej Industries Ltd and Godrej Agrovet Ltd; Mr Hayashi Nobumitsu, Governor of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation; Ms Verena Lim, CEO of Macquarie Group Asia; Mr Eugene Weng Soon Wong, CEO of the Sustainable Finance Institute; Mr Bill Winters, Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered; Ms Koike Yuriko, Governor of Tokyo; Mr Jesper Koll, Expert Director of Monex Group and Japan Catalyst Fund; and Dr Mari E.

Canberra branded the incident a consular case.</p><p>In November 2018, an Aussie football player of Bahraini descent, Hakeem al Araibi, was arrested on arrival in Bangkok. Thai police made the arrest following a Bahrain "red notice". He was detained in a Thai jail, awaiting deportation to Bahrain. However, in early February 2019, through the personal intervention of Foreign Affairs Minister Don Pramudwinai with the Bahraini government, the Thai Office of the Attorney-General dropped the extradition case against him at Bahrain&#039;s request. Araibi later returned to Australia. It was again described as a consular case.</p><p>These two episodes demonstrated the evolving relationship between Thailand and Australia following the May 2014 coup when the lives of Australians were at risk. Behind the scenes, Thailand used all available resources and connections to secure Australian citizens&#039; safety as in Dr Moore-Gilbert&#039;s case. Araibi was able to return to Australia after Bahrain withdrew the demand.</p><p>Then, in June 2018, a miracle happened. Australia was in the headlines throughout the world for weeks.

The rescue gradually removed the stigma surrounding Thai-Aussie ties.</p><p>In contrast, during the heyday of Thai-Aussie relations under various Labour governments in the 1990s, their close cooperation helped to bring peace to Cambodia and nation-building to East Timor. Lest we forget, back in September 1999, when Australia was looking for an Asean partner to join the planned peace-keeping operation in East Timor, Thailand was the first country to take up the challenge, while other Asean members were reluctant. Their joint command in peace-keeping in the newly independent nation was well documented and praised.</p><p>During the Cambodian conflict, Thailand and Australia stood side-by-side closely to bring about peace and the withdrawal of foreign troops. Canberra strongly supported Bangkok&#039;s position and the Asean framework.</p><p>Any discussion on modern Australian foreign policy towards Southeast Asia often features Thailand as a partner or a facilitator. After all, it was the Hawke government that funded the construction of the Thai-Lao bridge across the Mekong river, which was opened in 1994.

This year, Thailand and Australia commemorate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations. Over the past decade, relations have remained benign without any outstandingly difficult bilateral issues. Indeed, the most exciting news was the unprecedented visit of HM King Maha Vajiralongkorn to the Australian Embassy in February last year. Another headline was HM the King naming an alley after a former Australian envoy to Thailand, Allan McKinnon.
Among the liberal Western countries, Australia is just one of the few that does not suffer from the "trust deficit" due to the generally favourable attitude of the Thais towards the Australians, serving as a rock-solid foundation of Thailand-Australian relations. Their joint efforts in life-saving and peace-making are well known and continue today.
Given the ongoing dramatic shift in the strategic landscape throughout the world, Thai-Aussie relations have been under scrutiny by the US allies and friends, as both are treaty allies of the US in the Indo-Pacific region. Hence, the frequently asked question has been: What will be the future trajectory of their bilateral ties in responding to challenges posed by the growing US and China rivalry, the impacts of the Russian-Ukraine war, and the Myanmar crisis? In answering this, we can learn from the past.
In the 1990s, Thailand and Australia were considered buddies-in-arms in ending the Cambodian civil war. The two worked together within Asean and international contexts. Today, the region's biggest challenge is the Myanmar quagmire.
Indeed, a clarion call has gone out for them to collaborate again to bring about normalcy in Myanmar. It will not be an easy task as the current situation remains fluid, and the conflicting parties have to agree to discuss a ceasefire and action plan for humanitarian assistance. Thailand and Australia are on the same page when it comes to Myanmar. If the impasse continues to drag on, it will destabilise peace and stability in the region. Therefore, they must work together with Asean and the international community to find a solution that is acceptable to all.
When Aussie Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong makes her first scheduled visit to Thailand on November 1-2, she will be able to assess the situation in Myanmar with Thailand as a strategic partner. Her stay here will come hot on the heels of the two countries recently holding their first two-plus-two strategic dialogue between senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence. The discussions will provide input on their future action plans related to the whole gamut of their relations, including strategic and security matters.
Both countries will also discuss the upcoming Apec leaders' meeting and their input, as well as the possible official visit of Mr Albanese sometime next year. Since 1998, there have been no visits from an Aussie PM.
Truth be told, both sides have yet to maximise their economic relations even though they concluded a free trade agreement back in 2005. In 2020, Thailand's exports to Australia were about $10.3 billion, while Australia exported $5.4 billion to Thailand.

With the new Labor government, Australia has been enthusiastic about reaching out to Southeast Asia. Ms Wong has made it clear that Australia's security is intrinsically linked to Southeast Asia's security. She would be keen to discuss with Mr Don how their countries can rejuvenate their old spirit of cooperation for peace.
Indeed, now that Australia and Thailand want to strengthen further and maximise their decades-old relations, they will need to develop creative ways to boost their already unconventional ways of doing things.

Both sides are hopeful that the volume will hit the $100 billion mark by next year. The economic prospects are endless thanks to the popularity of Korean-made electronic products and gadgets inside Vietnam, particularly smartphones. Over 50% of Samsung&#039;s output for sale in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world came from Vietnam.</p><p>Vietnam was also one of the few Asean members to quickly take advantage of post-pandemic tourism and opened up for tourists at the end of last year. This enabled Korean tourists to visit at the most crucial time. Now Korean tourists rank No.1 during the pandemic period. Before the outbreak of Covid-19, nearly 4 million Koreans visited in 2019.</p><p>The success of Korea-Vietnam economic relations has been the envy of other Asean members. It is now taken up as a case study by Thai government agencies and the private sector on best practices in both countries in cooperating and managing their relations. ROK-Thai economic relations are underdeveloped in comparison with those of ROK-Vietnam. Last year, ROK-Thailand trade volume was a mere $15.5 billion even though the two countries have been trading for the past six decades. In fact, the two countries still have to do lots of homework to match their interests in all areas due to the lack of mutual awareness and understanding. More specifically, Thailand has yet to appreciate South Korea&#039;s modern economic and innovative potential. The Thai Board of Investment and related agencies must provide incentives for Korean investors. Traditionally, the country is considered a prime area of investment by Japan, the United States and China. Therefore, they have been accorded higher attention and care.</p><p>However, in the coming years, Thailand needs to reach out to both public and private sectors to tap into Korea&#039;s growing economic clout as well as technological and innovative strengths. Sad but true, Thai policymakers have not utilised Korea&#039;s longstanding goodwill and trust towards the country. Lest we forget, Thailand was one of the 16-nation international forces under UN command participating in the Korean War. After the war, Thailand also helped South Korea with its water management.

Over the past two decades, ROK has made many inroads by further strengthening ties with Asean. The overall statistics speak for themselves. Today, Korea has become a favourite place for Southeast Asians to work, study and travel. Last year, Asean citizens living in the country surpassed the half-million mark at 538,248. The largest numbers were Vietnamese at 208,740, or 39%, followed by Thais at 171,800, or 32%.</p><p>It must be noted here that Vietnam&#039;s educational ties with Korea are exceptional.

The second and third largest groups of students came from Indonesia with 1,732, and Myanmar with 1,621 students.

Of course, further efforts are needed to increase awareness among Korean youths to better understand the history and culture of Southeast Asia. In Asean, young people are receptive to Korean culture, especially in the entertainment field. This can serve as a people-centric platform to broaden and strengthen art and cultural cooperation, which will enhance mutual trust and respect for each other cultures.</p><p>After taking up new leadership in May, President Yoon Suk-yeol has made clear that Asean will remain the centrepiece of its regional and global diplomacy.

In addition, at the recent Asean meeting in Phnom Penh, Mr Park also informed Asean of Korea&#039;s intention to apply for Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) status at the upcoming Asean-related summit in November. This bold and timely move came amid Asean&#039;s desire to expand strategic ties with selective dialogue partners. In more ways than one, it also showed Seoul&#039;s confidence toward Asean. As a CSP, Korea can further consolidate Asean centrality and promote peace, economic progress and stability. Together, they can implement their common strategic objective of preventing any external power from establishing hegemony in the region.</p><p><em>This opinion piece was written by ERIA&#039;s Senior Communications Advisor, Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, and has been published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2395808/rising-s-korea-deepens-ties-with-asean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bangkok Post.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:65:"/uploads/news/20220920/rising-s-korea-deepens-ties-with-asean.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:17483:"Rising S Korea deepens ties with Asean Rising S Korea deepens ties with Asean By Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, Senior Communications Advisor:&nbsp;To witness the dynamism of South Korea's rise and its relationship with Asean and each bloc member, it is important to attend the reception marking the national day of Vietnam.

In addition, at the recent Asean meeting in Phnom Penh, Mr Park also informed Asean of Korea's intention to apply for Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) status at the upcoming Asean-related summit in November. This bold and timely move came amid Asean's desire to expand strategic ties with selective dialogue partners. In more ways than one, it also showed Seoul's confidence toward Asean. As a CSP, Korea can further consolidate Asean centrality and promote peace, economic progress and stability. Together, they can implement their common strategic objective of preventing any external power from establishing hegemony in the region.

Ravindra Ngo, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of The Asian Network, emphasised the importance of partnering with ERIA under its Empower Our Future series, which engages key players and stakeholders amongst The Asian Network members, including non-profit and corporate sectors, entrepreneurs, and young leaders.             2022-09-23 23 September 2022 2202 rebmetpeS 32 32-90-2202             .sredael gnuoy dna ,sruenerpertne ,srotces etaroproc dna tiforp-non gnidulcni ,srebmem krowteN naisA ehT tsgnoma sredlohekats dna sreyalp yek segagne hcihw ,seires erutuF ruO rewopmE sti rednu AIRE htiw gnirentrap fo ecnatropmi eht desisahpme ,krowteN naisA ehT fo reciffO evitucexE feihC dna rednuoF ,ogN ardnivaR

He made four main recommendations, including (i) promoting open, inclusive global trade, and investment multilateral governance, (ii) facilitating innovation, digitalization, and technology adoption, (iii) amplifying support to attain inclusivity in global value chains, and (iv) making trade and investment an impactful driver of the greener economy.</p><p>Through pre-recorded videos, four ministries gave speeches.

Mr Bahlil Lahadalia, Minister of Investment of the Republic of Indonesia, talked about the sustainable investment for green and just transition. Mr Agus Kartasasmita, Minister of Industry of the Republic of Indonesia, talked about the acceleration of industry 4.0 to support global trade and investment.</p><p>In the first panel session, Mr Koji Hachiyama delivered his remarks emphasizing the vital role of technology in investment, trade, and business, particularly during the recovery period after the COVID-19 pandemic. With the acceleration of digitalization, countries have developed a stronger foundation and more resilient International Production Networks.</p><p>He then announced that ERIA has launched the Comprehensive Asia Development Plan 3.0, or CADP 3.0, which aims to build a digitally connected society and economy under the four pillars of Integration, Innovation, Inclusiveness, and Sustainability. He invited G20 to support and realize the world envisioned by CADP 3.0. To do so, Mr Hachiyama conveyed that is essential to develop a digital infrastructure to support the startup community and to improve the human resources quality, which creates an environment that promotes the digital trade. Public-private partnership is also vital to encourage the involvement of the private sector. Finally, he highlighted the necessity to strengthen cybersecurity measures to enable digital business safely.</p><p>The second-panel session covered the topic of inclusive and resilient global value chains in the context of moving towards sustainable trade and investment. It was discussed by some prominent scholars, including Ms. Jasmine Begum, Director of Legal, Government and Corporate Affairs Microsoft Asia, Dr Juan Jose Daboub, Task Force Co-Chair; Director of Phillip Morris International, and Mr Ernst Coppens, Managing Director and CEO of Bayer ASEAN.</p><p>The event ended with concluding remarks by Mr Dharma Djojonegoro, Deputy Chair of B20 TITF. He summarized some key points from the panel discussion. Trade and Investment should drive growth that is sustainable, equally just, and equitably distributed. The potential of the ocean economy can be fully unleashed for global growth with sustainable practices.</p><p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R5R05ji9t3c" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:119:"/uploads/news/20220923/2022_sep_eria-participated-in-the-b20-g20-dialogue-trade-and-investment-task-force_800x450-1.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:8343:"ERIA Participated in the B20 â€“ G20 Dialogue: Trade and Investment Task Force ERIA Participated in the B20 â€“ G20 Dialogue: Trade and Investment Task Force Labuan Bajo, 23 September 2022:&nbsp;The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) participated in the B20-G20 Dialogue: Trade and Investment Task Force.

In the first panel session, Mr Koji Hachiyama delivered his remarks emphasizing the vital role of technology in investment, trade, and business, particularly during the recovery period after the COVID-19 pandemic. With the acceleration of digitalization, countries have developed a stronger foundation and more resilient International Production Networks.
He then announced that ERIA has launched the Comprehensive Asia Development Plan 3.0, or CADP 3.0, which aims to build a digitally connected society and economy under the four pillars of Integration, Innovation, Inclusiveness, and Sustainability. He invited G20 to support and realize the world envisioned by CADP 3.0. To do so, Mr Hachiyama conveyed that is essential to develop a digital infrastructure to support the startup community and to improve the human resources quality, which creates an environment that promotes the digital trade. Public-private partnership is also vital to encourage the involvement of the private sector. Finally, he highlighted the necessity to strengthen cybersecurity measures to enable digital business safely.
The second-panel session covered the topic of inclusive and resilient global value chains in the context of moving towards sustainable trade and investment. It was discussed by some prominent scholars, including Ms. Jasmine Begum, Director of Legal, Government and Corporate Affairs Microsoft Asia, Dr Juan Jose Daboub, Task Force Co-Chair; Director of Phillip Morris International, and Mr Ernst Coppens, Managing Director and CEO of Bayer ASEAN.
The event ended with concluding remarks by Mr Dharma Djojonegoro, Deputy Chair of B20 TITF. He summarized some key points from the panel discussion. Trade and Investment should drive growth that is sustainable, equally just, and equitably distributed. The potential of the ocean economy can be fully unleashed for global growth with sustainable practices.             2022-09-23 23 September 2022 2202 rebmetpeS 32 32-90-2202             .secitcarp elbaniatsus htiw htworg labolg rof dehsaelnu ylluf eb nac ymonoce naeco eht fo laitnetop ehT .detubirtsid ylbatiuqe dna ,tsuj yllauqe ,elbaniatsus si taht htworg evird dluohs tnemtsevnI dna edarT .noissucsid lenap eht morf stniop yek emos dezirammus eH .FTIT 02B fo riahC ytupeD ,orogenojojD amrahD rM yb skramer gnidulcnoc htiw dedne tneve ehT

However, the world is currently encountering high inflation, a global economic slowdown, the effects of the pandemic, geopolitical challenges, and a wide-spread food security crisis. Trade restrictions can amplify economic shocks, thus maintaining economic resilience requires diversification of economic relationships, including cross-border trade and investment. She recommends that the G20 promote trade openness and flexibility through the World Trade Organization (WTO), and clarify and strengthen trade rules, including on agricultural and industrial subsidies. The G20 should think creatively about how to move forward through the WTO to secure greater openness, including in services and digital trade. Policy transparency and predictability are key for job creation and a well-functioning WTO Dispute Settlement helps for this purpose.</p><p>Ms Shinta W Kamdani, Chair of the Business Twenty Indonesia (B20 Indonesia) recommended specific policies and stated the importance of &lsquo;reframing the role of trade and investment&rsquo; in supporting global economic recovery and keeping the flows of goods, services, and investment open in times of uncertainty. The B20 Indonesia recommended four policies to the G20: promote open, fair, inclusive, and efficient post-pandemic global trade and investment, strengthen multilateral cooperation, including reforming the WTO; facilitate innovation, digitalisation, and technology adoption to support international development and mitigation of future global crises; amplify support to attain inclusivity in global supply and value chains; and make trade and investment impactful drivers for greener and more sustainable development in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. The B20 invited G20 companies to continuously evolve and adopt practices that promote inclusivity, resilience, and sustainability for small and large organisations and to support the economic growth of MSMEs and advocate their inclusion in global supply chains.</p><p>Dr Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Director General of WTO, presented the progress of the WTO reform based on the outcomes of the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12), which &lsquo;underlined the important role of trade and the WTO in facing crises, empowering the vulnerable, remaining responsive to the needs of sustainability, and the enabling environment for the digital economy&rsquo;. She also underpinned the essentiality of implementation, in line with the MC 12 Commitments.</p><p>Prof Mari Elka Pangestu, Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships of the World Bank reported current world economic conditions including debt crisis pressures, the significant rise in global poverty and inequality due to COVID-19, and geopolitical tensions. Surges in food and energy prices are causing capital outflows to advanced economies. To address these challenges, actions must be directed to removing global supply bottlenecks, improving market efficiency, and keeping trade and investment open. To foster trust in multilateralism, trade and investment should provide widespread benefits to people at all levels of society. The World Bank called for enhanced trade cooperation between states, non-state actors, and the private sector.</p><p>During the discussion on Spurring Sustainable Investment for Global Economic Recovery, Dr Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, emphasised the &lsquo;unique opportunities for the G20&rsquo; to lead strategies and implement initiatives for sustainable investment in renewable energy through the formulation of a policy toolkit on promoting mutually beneficial sustainable investment in renewable energy. She underscored the importance of collaboration between G20 members in investment promotion and facilitation, renewable energy technology dissemination, cooperation through carbon markets, and technical assistance that can help developing countries promote sustainable investment in renewable energy and address related challenges.</p><p>Prof Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, called for &lsquo;better cross-country collaboration that enables a more robust and resilient supply of health technologies, responsive to public health needs, and more equitable in allocation and distribution&rsquo;. She asked for policy intervention and regional collaborative actions to ensure vaccine equality and resiliency of value chains for low- and middle-income countries to mitigate future emerging infectious disease threat.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:120:"/uploads/news/20220923/2022_sep_eria-president-digitalisation-in-the-g20-shall-promote-development-for-all_800x450-1.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:15277:"ERIA President : Digitalisation in the G20 Shall Promote Development for All ERIA President : Digitalisation in the G20 Shall Promote Development for All Bali, 23 September 2022: &lsquo;Deployment of industrial robots and AI promises substantial productivity gains, but it can also contribute to increasing inequalities&rsquo;.

Ms Shinta W Kamdani, Chair of the Business Twenty Indonesia (B20 Indonesia) recommended specific policies and stated the importance of &lsquo;reframing the role of trade and investment&rsquo; in supporting global economic recovery and keeping the flows of goods, services, and investment open in times of uncertainty. The B20 Indonesia recommended four policies to the G20: promote open, fair, inclusive, and efficient post-pandemic global trade and investment, strengthen multilateral cooperation, including reforming the WTO; facilitate innovation, digitalisation, and technology adoption to support international development and mitigation of future global crises; amplify support to attain inclusivity in global supply and value chains; and make trade and investment impactful drivers for greener and more sustainable development in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. The B20 invited G20 companies to continuously evolve and adopt practices that promote inclusivity, resilience, and sustainability for small and large organisations and to support the economic growth of MSMEs and advocate their inclusion in global supply chains.
Dr Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Director General of WTO, presented the progress of the WTO reform based on the outcomes of the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12), which &lsquo;underlined the important role of trade and the WTO in facing crises, empowering the vulnerable, remaining responsive to the needs of sustainability, and the enabling environment for the digital economy&rsquo;. She also underpinned the essentiality of implementation, in line with the MC 12 Commitments.
Prof Mari Elka Pangestu, Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships of the World Bank reported current world economic conditions including debt crisis pressures, the significant rise in global poverty and inequality due to COVID-19, and geopolitical tensions. Surges in food and energy prices are causing capital outflows to advanced economies. To address these challenges, actions must be directed to removing global supply bottlenecks, improving market efficiency, and keeping trade and investment open. To foster trust in multilateralism, trade and investment should provide widespread benefits to people at all levels of society. The World Bank called for enhanced trade cooperation between states, non-state actors, and the private sector.
During the discussion on Spurring Sustainable Investment for Global Economic Recovery, Dr Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, emphasised the &lsquo;unique opportunities for the G20&rsquo; to lead strategies and implement initiatives for sustainable investment in renewable energy through the formulation of a policy toolkit on promoting mutually beneficial sustainable investment in renewable energy. She underscored the importance of collaboration between G20 members in investment promotion and facilitation, renewable energy technology dissemination, cooperation through carbon markets, and technical assistance that can help developing countries promote sustainable investment in renewable energy and address related challenges.
Prof Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, called for &lsquo;better cross-country collaboration that enables a more robust and resilient supply of health technologies, responsive to public health needs, and more equitable in allocation and distribution&rsquo;. She asked for policy intervention and regional collaborative actions to ensure vaccine equality and resiliency of value chains for low- and middle-income countries to mitigate future emerging infectious disease threat.             2022-09-23 23 September 2022 2202 rebmetpeS 32 32-90-2202             .taerht esaesid suoitcefni gnigreme erutuf etagitim ot seirtnuoc emocni-elddim dna -wol rof sniahc eulav fo ycneiliser dna ytilauqe eniccav erusne ot snoitca evitaroballoc lanoiger dna noitnevretni ycilop rof deksa ehS .;ouqsr&noitubirtsid dna noitacolla ni elbatiuqe erom dna ,sdeen htlaeh cilbup ot evisnopser ,seigolonhcet htlaeh fo ylppus tneiliser dna tsubor erom a selbane taht noitaroballoc yrtnuoc-ssorc retteb;ouqsl& rof dellac ,cificaP eht dna aisA rof noissimmoC laicoS dna cimonocE snoitaN detinU eht fo yraterceS evitucexE ,anabhajsilA haislaS adimrA forP

To address these issues, she said investment measures in promoting sustainable, climate-resilient, and inclusive investment should be facilitated, and sustainability and inclusivity in the transition towards Industry 4.0, particularly in manufacturing, should be considered. She recommended that the G20 members &nbsp;continue and build on existing multilateral collaboration, such as the WTO Joint Statement on Investment Facilitation for Development, for a more sustainable, predictable, non-discriminatory, and transparent investment climate; and pay greater attention to systematic efforts to improve the skills of their workforce as they transition towards Industry 4.0 to avoid widening inequalities as an unintended consequence. She emphasised the importance of sustainable investment and sustainable industrialisation as the foundation for resilient and inclusive economic recovery. Noting the importance of sharing the best practices on sustainable investment, Dr Ing voiced her support for the proposed establishment of G20 Sustainable Investment Policy Compedium.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:85:"/uploads/news/20220920/2022_sep_g20-urged-to-aim-for-inclusive-digital_800x450-4.jpeg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:7435:"G20 Urged to Aim for Inclusive Digital Transformation, Sustainable Investment and Industrialisation in TIIWG Meet G20 Urged to Aim for Inclusive Digital Transformation, Sustainable Investment and Industrialisation in TIIWG Meet Bali, 20 September 2022: Raising collective action and strengthening commitments under Indonesia&rsquo;s Group of Twenty (G20) Trade, Investment and Industry (TII) priorities were the focus of the G20 3rd Trade, Investment and Industry Working Group (TIIWG) Meeting on 19&ndash;20 September 2022 at the Sofitel Nusa Dua Bali Resort in Bali, Indonesia.

To address these issues, she said investment measures in promoting sustainable, climate-resilient, and inclusive investment should be facilitated, and sustainability and inclusivity in the transition towards Industry 4.0, particularly in manufacturing, should be considered. She recommended that the G20 members &nbsp;continue and build on existing multilateral collaboration, such as the WTO Joint Statement on Investment Facilitation for Development, for a more sustainable, predictable, non-discriminatory, and transparent investment climate; and pay greater attention to systematic efforts to improve the skills of their workforce as they transition towards Industry 4.0 to avoid widening inequalities as an unintended consequence. She emphasised the importance of sustainable investment and sustainable industrialisation as the foundation for resilient and inclusive economic recovery. Noting the importance of sharing the best practices on sustainable investment, Dr Ing voiced her support for the proposed establishment of G20 Sustainable Investment Policy Compedium.             2022-09-20 20 September 2022 2202 rebmetpeS 02 02-90-2202             .muidepmoC yciloP tnemtsevnI elbaniatsuS 02G fo tnemhsilbatse desoporp eht rof troppus reh deciov gnI rD ,tnemtsevni elbaniatsus no secitcarp tseb eht gnirahs fo ecnatropmi eht gnitoN .yrevocer cimonoce evisulcni dna tneiliser rof noitadnuof eht sa noitasilairtsudni elbaniatsus dna tnemtsevni elbaniatsus fo ecnatropmi eht desisahpme ehS .ecneuqesnoc dednetninu na sa seitilauqeni gninediw diova ot 0.4 yrtsudnI sdrawot noitisnart yeht sa ecrofkrow rieht fo slliks eht evorpmi ot stroffe citametsys ot noitnetta retaerg yap dna ;etamilc tnemtsevni tnerapsnart dna ,yrotanimircsid-non ,elbatciderp ,elbaniatsus erom a rof ,tnempoleveD rof noitatilicaF tnemtsevnI no tnemetatS tnioJ OTW eht sa hcus ,noitaroballoc laretalitlum gnitsixe no dliub dna eunitnoc;psbn& srebmem 02G eht taht dednemmocer ehS .deredisnoc eb dluohs ,gnirutcafunam ni ylralucitrap ,0.4 yrtsudnI sdrawot noitisnart eht ni ytivisulcni dna ytilibaniatsus dna ,detatilicaf eb dluohs tnemtsevni evisulcni dna ,tneiliser-etamilc ,elbaniatsus gnitomorp ni serusaem tnemtsevni dias ehs ,seussi eseht sserdda oT .egnahc etamilc dna ytilauqeni gnisir :seussi tnempoleved gnidnats-gnol owt htiw gnola ,ymonoce labolg eht ot segnellahc suoires desop evah taht snoisnet lacitilop labolg gnisir eht dna cimednap 91-DIVOC eht fo tcapmi eht denilrednu gnI rD ,0.4 yrtsudnI dna tnemtsevni elbaniatsus no snoissucsid gniruD

On 17 September, Prof Nishimura also made a presentation to the 25th&nbsp;ASEAN Plus Three Consultation on &lsquo;Closing the Digital Divide in Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises.&rsquo; (See presentation).
The Joint Media Statement of the ASEAN Plus Three welcomed ERIA&rsquo;s research on digitalization and MSMEs (See full statement):

The Meeting welcomed the ASEAN Plus Three Research Project for Closing the Digital Divide in MSMEs undertaken by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) and the ASEAN Secretariat. The initiative highlights the importance of digital tools and solutions in narrowing the gaps in infrastructure connectivity, access to market, digital skills, and financing capabilities of MSMEs. In welcoming the study, the Meeting underscored the critical role of digitalisation in the APT region&rsquo;s post-pandemic economic recovery, particularly in building the resilience of MSMEs by enabling them to develop digital start-ups and adopt digital solutions for innovation and entrepreneurship.

The Joint Media Statement of the 54th ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting, held 13-15 September 2022, appreciated ERIA&rsquo;s contributions in four paragraphs (see full statement):
Paragraph 15 noted the importance of the NTM Toolkit which was developed with the support of ERIA in 2021:
15. Noting the importance of the Non-Tariff Measures Cost-Effectiveness Toolkit (NTM Toolkit) as a guideline to manage NTMs affecting the flow of goods within the region, the Meeting encouraged two interested AMSs, namely Brunei, and Malaysia, to expedite their domestic processes to implement the NTM Toolkit on a voluntary basis as soon as possible. The Meeting also noted the completion of the 'Methodology in Conducting the Ex-Ante Regulatory Review on the Draft NTMs Before They Are Imposed by the ASEAN Member States' and encouraged ASEAN Member States to consider applying it in reviewing any draft NTMs before implementation.
Paragraph 16 noted ERIA&rsquo;s work on trade facilitation:

The Meeting noted the completion of the 'Follow-up Study of the ASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators (ASTFI II)' with the support of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) and also noted that its public version will be published in the first quarter of 2023 to raise the public&rsquo;s awareness of ASEAN&rsquo;s trade facilitation initiatives.

Paragraph 55 expressed appreciation of ERIA&rsquo;s support to the Cambodian Chairmanship in 2022:

Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA). The Meeting expressed appreciation to ERIA for its continued support to the ASEAN economic integration and AEC-building efforts, particularly in delivering the Priority Economic Deliverables under the Cambodia Chairmanship in 2022, which include: (i) the Work Programme to Support the Implementation of the Framework for Circular Economy for the ASEAN Economic Community; (ii) the Development of the ASEAN Guidelines on Sustainable Agriculture; (iii) the Launch of ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) Upgrade Negotiations; (iv) the Development of the Work Plan for the Implementation of the ASEAN Framework for Equitable Economic Development (AFEED); (v) the Framework on Sustainable Tourism Development in ASEAN in Post COVID-19 Era; and (vi) the Comprehensive Study on the Implementation of Mutual Recognition Arrangements for Tourism Professional (MRA-TP): Enhanced Mechanism for Tourism Professionals.

Paragraph 56 acknowledged ERIA&rsquo;s research activities regarding ASEAN economic integration:

The Meeting also acknowledged ERIA&rsquo;s research activities and studies to contribute to the implementation of many ASEAN initiatives in various areas of regional economic integration, including: (i) the completion of the 2nd Study on ASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators (ASTFI II); (ii) the Implementation Plan of Framework for Circular Economy (FCE) for the AEC; (iii) the publication of the ASEAN Handbook on Good Regulatory Practices; (iv) the study on the supply and demand of professional services in ASEAN which includes how to enhance the level of interaction and mobility of ASEAN professional services due to the evolving services trade landscape; (v) transposition of the schedules of commitments from the positive listing approach into the negative listing approach under the ATISA; and (vi) the development of a training programme for ASEAN professionals (e.g., engineers, architects, accountants, and surveyors) to integrate the knowledge on the 4IR based on ASEAN Consolidated Strategy on 4IR, in the way they supply their services. The Meeting further acknowledged ERIA&rsquo;s capacity-building programme and expressed its appreciation for the assistance given to CLM particularly with regard to implementing their RCEP commitments, e.g., rules of origin and transposition of tariff reduction schedules.             2022-09-17 17 September 2022 2202 rebmetpeS 71 71-90-2202             .seludehcs noitcuder ffirat fo noitisopsnart dna nigiro fo selur ,.g.e ,stnemtimmoc PECR rieht gnitnemelpmi ot drager htiw ylralucitrap MLC ot nevig ecnatsissa eht rof noitaicerppa sti desserpxe dna emmargorp gnidliub-yticapac s;ouqsr&AIRE degdelwonkca rehtruf gniteeM ehT .secivres rieht ylppus yeht yaw eht ni ,RI4 no ygetartS detadilosnoC NAESA no desab RI4 eht no egdelwonk eht etargetni ot )sroyevrus dna ,stnatnuocca ,stcetihcra ,sreenigne ,.g.e( slanoisseforp NAESA rof emmargorp gniniart a fo tnempoleved eht )iv( dna ;ASITA eht rednu hcaorppa gnitsil evitagen eht otni hcaorppa gnitsil evitisop eht morf stnemtimmoc fo seludehcs eht fo noitisopsnart )v( ;epacsdnal edart secivres gnivlove eht ot eud secivres lanoisseforp NAESA fo ytilibom dna noitcaretni fo level eht ecnahne ot woh sedulcni hcihw NAESA ni secivres lanoisseforp fo dnamed dna ylppus eht no yduts eht )vi( ;secitcarP yrotalugeR dooG no koobdnaH NAESA eht fo noitacilbup eht )iii( ;CEA eht rof )ECF( ymonocE ralucriC rof krowemarF fo nalP noitatnemelpmI eht )ii( ;)II IFTSA( srotacidnI noitatilicaF edarT sselmaeS NAESA no ydutS dn2 eht fo noitelpmoc eht )i( :gnidulcni ,noitargetni cimonoce lanoiger fo saera suoirav ni sevitaitini NAESA ynam fo noitatnemelpmi eht ot etubirtnoc ot seiduts dna seitivitca hcraeser s;ouqsr&AIRE degdelwonkca osla gniteeM ehT

The policy brief is published by Think20 (T20), the G20&rsquo;s official engagement group of leading thinktanks and research institutions worldwide, which offers evidence-based policy recommendations based on topics under three priority areas&mdash;global health architecture; digital transformation; and sustainable energy transition.
This policy brief investigates the gaps in the existing international treaties on plastic pollution and proposes components that need to be considered in a new treaty.
&lsquo;These proposals will complement the G20 works on plastic pollution,&rsquo; said Michikazu Kojima, Senior Advisor of ERIA and one of the authors of the policy brief.
&lsquo;Furthermore, since the G20 summit is held in Indonesia, the focus of this policy brief will not only be relevant to G20 countries but also to Southeast Asia as the biggest contributor of marine plastics,&rsquo; added Mr Kojima, who also leads ERIA&rsquo;s Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris (RKC-MPD).
Marine plastic pollution has become a critical issue on a global scale, bringing detrimental environmental impacts, including the death of marine species caused by plastic entanglement and ingestion. Southeast Asia is considered the biggest contributor of marine plastics. A recent study shows that the region (except Lao People&rsquo;s Democratic Republic) disposes into the ocean more than 55 percent of the world&rsquo;s total output of plastic waste.
Several international treaties covering plastic waste have been enacted. The London Convention, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), the Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Basel Convention are amongst the prominent treaties that address the issue. However, those regulations lack comprehensive discussions on the life cycle of plastics, legally binding agreements, monitoring methods, and quantified targets on plastic pollution. The situation calls for an international treaty that encompasses all components related to plastic pollution must be created.
Earlier this year, the United Nations Environment Assembly 5.2 adopted &lsquo;End plastic pollution: towards an international legally binding instrument,&rsquo; a resolution seeking to organise an intergovernmental negotiating committee to develop the international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution.
The Group of 20 (G20) has contributed to the resolution of the plastic pollution issue. In the G20 Hamburg Summit in 2017, the G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter was formulated. In June 2019, the G20 Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastic Litter was established at the G20 Ministerial Meeting on Energy Transitions and Global Environment for Sustainable Growth.

Within 24 hours, ASEAN issued a joint statement reaffirming its One China policy. The bloc also called for all parties to exercise maximum restraint and refrain from provocative action. Furthermore, ASEAN urged them to uphold the principles enshrined in the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (T&Aacute;C).

The future of ASEAN depends on its adaptability in responding to the emerging political and economic landscape. ASEAN has learned that, to survive, the bloc has to be a neutral and safe place in which all powers can engage in dialogue and build trust and confidence, as they just did in Phnom Penh.

They felt the bloc&rsquo;s reputation has been ruined as the executions were carried out just days ahead of the annual meeting despite an&nbsp; appeal by the Asean chair.
From the Asean chair&rsquo;s perspective, the death sentences were &ldquo;highly reprehensible&rdquo; as they created a serious setback and demonstrated a gross lack of will to support the chair&rsquo;s efforts.

Malaysia has become the first Asean member to break ranks and meet up with representatives of NUG. If Myanmar continues this bloody trajectory, the incoming chair will not stand idly by and could allow the NUG to open an office in Jakarta to ramp up pressure on the junta.

Early next month, the special envoy is scheduled to make a third visit to Nay Pyi Taw on a very important visit. He hopes that the long-awaited request for a meeting with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will be fulfilled.
In addition, the communique also recognised Hun Sen&rsquo;s early attempt to secure the release of Dr Sean Turnell, an Australian economist and an advisor to Ms Suu Kyi.
For the next critical 10 weeks, Myanmar&rsquo;s future in Asean hangs in the balance. Never before in the 55-year-old history of Asean have the leaders laid out such conditions for a member to fulfil. The SAC must not underestimate the bloc&rsquo;s collective determination.
After all, Myanmar is a litmus test for Asean&rsquo;s credibility and solidarity when it comes to dealing with a pariah member of the family.

For Southeast Asia, her accession has brought new concerns about the UK&rsquo;s future role in this part of the world.</p><p>Most importantly, she has to deal with her headline-grabbing views about the world, which she mastered during her brief stint as foreign secretary that started in September 2021, especially about collective security in the Indo-Pacific region and China&rsquo;s vitriol.</p><p>Of course, what politicians say during their electoral campaigns must be carefully scrutinised, as it is aimed at a specific audience to garner support and votes. Therefore, it is expected that, in the coming days, Truss will come up with a clear foreign policy toward the Indo-Pacific and other transnational issues. At the outset, she reiterated that her government would &ldquo;deliver, deliver, deliver&rdquo; on all fronts.</p><p>Internationally, whatever the UK chooses to say and do will impact Southeast Asia. Its colonial past still haunts this region. Now, as the newest dialogue partner of ASEAN, the UK has a unique opportunity to do the right things, in its role as a member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, G7 and G20, among other international bodies.</p><p>It is important to remind Truss that her hawkish world views will not augur well in the region, especially in during a period of economic recovery. She even suggested that democracies build a network to oppose authoritarian states. In Thailand, as well as in other ASEAN members, her comments on the creation of a global NATO was a fierce topic of debate. Political pundits and academia in region fear that ASEAN could be dragged further into superpower rivalries. ASEAN is not a military alliance. Any attempt to change this status quo will inevitably fail.</p><p>During her visit to the region last November, she emphasised that the UK profile in the region, especially in terms of economic cooperation, was &ldquo;underpowered&rdquo;, given the bloc&rsquo;s dynamism and the so-called Global Britain. She wanted to change this trajectory, because it would create jobs and opportunities for the UK in the region.</p><p>As such, she has lots of homework to do to further strengthen ties with ASEAN as a whole.

For Southeast Asia, her accession has brought new concerns about the UK&rsquo;s future role in this part of the world.
Most importantly, she has to deal with her headline-grabbing views about the world, which she mastered during her brief stint as foreign secretary that started in September 2021, especially about collective security in the Indo-Pacific region and China&rsquo;s vitriol.
Of course, what politicians say during their electoral campaigns must be carefully scrutinised, as it is aimed at a specific audience to garner support and votes. Therefore, it is expected that, in the coming days, Truss will come up with a clear foreign policy toward the Indo-Pacific and other transnational issues. At the outset, she reiterated that her government would &ldquo;deliver, deliver, deliver&rdquo; on all fronts.
Internationally, whatever the UK chooses to say and do will impact Southeast Asia. Its colonial past still haunts this region. Now, as the newest dialogue partner of ASEAN, the UK has a unique opportunity to do the right things, in its role as a member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, G7 and G20, among other international bodies.
It is important to remind Truss that her hawkish world views will not augur well in the region, especially in during a period of economic recovery. She even suggested that democracies build a network to oppose authoritarian states. In Thailand, as well as in other ASEAN members, her comments on the creation of a global NATO was a fierce topic of debate. Political pundits and academia in region fear that ASEAN could be dragged further into superpower rivalries. ASEAN is not a military alliance. Any attempt to change this status quo will inevitably fail.
During her visit to the region last November, she emphasised that the UK profile in the region, especially in terms of economic cooperation, was &ldquo;underpowered&rdquo;, given the bloc&rsquo;s dynamism and the so-called Global Britain. She wanted to change this trajectory, because it would create jobs and opportunities for the UK in the region.
As such, she has lots of homework to do to further strengthen ties with ASEAN as a whole. It is necessary to say at the outset that, in the post COVID-19 pandemic era, ASEAN&rsquo;s economic progress and well-being depend very much on its stable engagement with China and other economies. Any attempt to disrupt these relations, intentionally or otherwise, would have adverse effects on the grouping&rsquo;s external ties, which include the UK itself.
In the days ahead, Truss must go beyond the media headlines and optics and demonstrate her country&rsquo;s seriousness in repositioning her country in the Indo-Pacific, especially within the context of ASEAN. She must do away with her &ldquo;one-size fits all&rdquo; comments regarding the region, due to its diversity and diverse national interests.

Over time, it has become obvious that Republic of Korea (ROK)-China ties are not what they seem, especially under the Yoon administration. The old thorny issue of the installation of a US Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (Thaad) system has reared its ugly head again.
Putting the two events together, one can appreciate ROK's diplomatic balancing act with China under the watchful eyes of the US and other allies. It must be clear at this juncture that South Korea's current dilemma is unique, given its close proximity and past history with its giant neighbour.
From the beginning, the Yoon administration has made it clear that South Korea wants stable, peaceful and prosperous ties with China. After all, China is the No 1 export market for South Korean products, amounting to 25% of its total exports. Prior to 2017, Chinese tourists used to be a good source of foreign earnings for ROK as well. At the present, Beijing also needs semiconductors from ROK, importing nearly 40% of its production to feed its hungry hi-tech-related industries.
In the past, key security issues, especially the stationing of Thaad, were stumbling blocks for further ROK-China rapprochement. The government at the time decided that with possible nuclear threats from North Korea, it was imperative to have a countermeasure. The decision was made on that basis. Under the government of Moon Jae-in, Thaad was pushed back, opening the way for improved bilateral ties.
However, with the new administration, South Korea's position on Thaad is clear. Last week, Defence Minister Lee Jong-sup made clear that the operation of Thaad is not a matter of negotiation. It is a matter of national defence and an issue of sovereignty. However, China has urged the Yoon administration to follow the "Three Nos" -- no further Thaad deployment, no link with a US-led missile defence system and no three-way alliance with the US and Japan. Seoul has disassociated with the call.
Apparently, Beijing was not convinced of Seoul's intention, due to the system's radar capacity, which could undermine its security interests. Seoul's position was further complicated by the plan to join the consultation on "Chip 4," which has been pushed by the Biden administration, later this month.





Again, Korea will stress that joining this hi-tech supply chain body is also in its national interest to be part of the high-end semiconductor-related ecosystem.
However, with ongoing US-China rivalries rising, ROK is caught in a catch-22 situation as the US is diligently seeking to isolate China from the supply chains of hi-tech products.
For the past three decades, South Korea has been walking a tightrope so as not to upset its staunch security alliance with the US while maintaining excellent trade ties with China.

While Washington tries to decouple security and economic issues, the future of ROK-China relations is increasingly dependent on how the two countries would marry security and economic interests together without one jeopardising the other. For both, it is economic security that each tries to preserve, especially the stability of supply chains.
Previously, ROK and China would get along with diplomatic talks as long as it preserved the so-called "strategic ambiguity", which has been mutually beneficial to the maintenance of stable ties.
Now, some South Korean specialists on China believed that the intensified US-China conflict coupled with the disastrous impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war have shattered past ambiguities, which currently demand more clarity in diplomatic engagements, especially with Beijing.
One way or another, those allies and friends of the US and China are unlikely in the coming days to avoid this dilemma as they are demanding visible support.
In the South Korean democracy, an incoming administration, especially one belonging to an opposing party, will bring in different policies and measures, especially those related to the domestic front as well as foreign affairs.
Throughout the three decades of friendship, South Korea's policies toward China have gone through a cycle of ups and downs but this has not disrupted the overall status quo, which allows strong economic ties. However, it is a different ball game today as the geopolitical landscape has changed radically.
That explains why Mr Wang told Mr Park that their ties should be more mature, independent and stable. In other words, both sides need to have strategic trust based on their national interest. In the weeks to come, South Korea and China will have to continue their dialogue to reach a new modus operandi that will allow their relations to proceed under a more restrictive and contested strategic landscape. During Mr Park's visit, both sides concurred that their disagreement over Thaad should not hamper progress in their bilateral ties.
Following such a pathway, China's latest five-point plan governing ties with South Korea (non-interference, maintenance of supply chain, multilateralism, among others) and Seoul's principles -- mutual respect, equity, mutual benefit and mutual trust enhancement -- can go hand-in-hand.
From this vantage point, both countries have already laid out sufficient common foundations to enhance strategic trust and consolidate their relations.

Of course, nobody would know what the two touched upon during their closed-door meeting. That was not to be.</p><p>Before the UN special envoy, Noeleen Heyzer, left Nay Pyi Taw after meeting with Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, she released a two-page press statement detailing her encounter with the junta, officially known as the State Administrative Council (SAC), which seized power in Myanmar in February 2021. All the points she made and on which she pressed the junta are well-known.</p><div id="innity_adslot_324001_1662947841875"><p>In a nutshell, she completed her first ever mission by delivering the UN&rsquo;s concerns about the dire situation inside Myanmar, which needs the full cooperation of the SAC to de-escalate the violence and the so-called &ldquo;multidimensional crisis&rdquo; that followed the coup. The UN also urged the SAC to impose a moratorium on all future executions and release all political prisoners.</p><p>During the meeting, she requested to meet with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and asked for her to return home soon as she is the critical stakeholder with whom to engage. There was a sense of deja vu about the outcome last weekend as news reports from Nay Phi Taw stated that the junta&rsquo;s chief was open to negotiations with Suu Kyi to end the quagmire. Lest we forget, after the coup, the UN special envoy on Myanmar has been trying to visit Myanmar. Heyzer&rsquo;s predecessor, Christine Schraner Burgener, was denied entry to Myanmar.</p><p>However, on Friday, the Global New Light of Myanmar published the so-called &ldquo;full description&rdquo;, a 4,954-word record, of the meeting on 17 August, which put a spanner in the works. Since it was not the so-called verbatim transcript, it was possible that certain parts of their exchanges could be omitted and misinterpreted, depending on the Information Team of the SAC. It is obvious as the sunrise in the morning that the regime decided to retaliate against the UN by telling its own version.</p><p>The sudden turn of events was unprecedented since it was the special envoy&rsquo;s first visit.

Of course, nobody would know what the two touched upon during their closed-door meeting. That was not to be.
Before the UN special envoy, Noeleen Heyzer, left Nay Pyi Taw after meeting with Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, she released a two-page press statement detailing her encounter with the junta, officially known as the State Administrative Council (SAC), which seized power in Myanmar in February 2021. All the points she made and on which she pressed the junta are well-known.

In a nutshell, she completed her first ever mission by delivering the UN&rsquo;s concerns about the dire situation inside Myanmar, which needs the full cooperation of the SAC to de-escalate the violence and the so-called &ldquo;multidimensional crisis&rdquo; that followed the coup. The UN also urged the SAC to impose a moratorium on all future executions and release all political prisoners.
During the meeting, she requested to meet with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and asked for her to return home soon as she is the critical stakeholder with whom to engage. There was a sense of deja vu about the outcome last weekend as news reports from Nay Phi Taw stated that the junta&rsquo;s chief was open to negotiations with Suu Kyi to end the quagmire. Lest we forget, after the coup, the UN special envoy on Myanmar has been trying to visit Myanmar. Heyzer&rsquo;s predecessor, Christine Schraner Burgener, was denied entry to Myanmar.
However, on Friday, the Global New Light of Myanmar published the so-called &ldquo;full description&rdquo;, a 4,954-word record, of the meeting on 17 August, which put a spanner in the works. Since it was not the so-called verbatim transcript, it was possible that certain parts of their exchanges could be omitted and misinterpreted, depending on the Information Team of the SAC. It is obvious as the sunrise in the morning that the regime decided to retaliate against the UN by telling its own version.
The sudden turn of events was unprecedented since it was the special envoy&rsquo;s first visit. After all, it is not normal to have the record exposed in the media in such a dramatic way, especially in the state media unless there are bigger ulterior motives in Nay Phi Taw. Given the circumstances, there are several takeaways from the spat, apart from the junta&rsquo;s strongly held positions on the current situation in Myanmar, which could impact the long-term relations between the UN and the SAC as well as the current cooperation with Asean.
First of all, although the visit was viewed as focusing on &ldquo;trust and cooperation&rdquo; building, the reports showed that the UN and the junta are still a world apart. Both sides had their most important messages delivered. The UN wanted the SAC to stop violence and release all prisoners, amongst other demands. In response, Senior Gen Min Aung Hlaing had an unequivocal clear message to the UN, that the current UN credentials accorded to the previous government must change. Since the coup, the UN seat has remained occupied by Kyaw Moe Thun, who was appointed by the previous government under the National Leagues of Democracy. For the SAC, this change would be its top priority.
From the disclosure, the SAC lamented the lack of assistance by the international community, especially the UN, which is supposed to provide humanitarian assistance to all without discrimination. His criticism of the UN humanitarian role came as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was undertaking shuttle diplomacy to ease the tension and food crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine. The SAC wanted to see the UN adopt new approaches to engaging with them.
Surprisingly, the senior general also felt uneasy about the mounting pressure from the Asean family. He also singled out the bloc&rsquo;s humanitarian wing, the Asean Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Center) which has &ldquo;only rendered a little assistance to Myanmar&rdquo;. This was intriguing that he mentioned it.
The SAC is supposed to work with the AHA Center, under the new Executive Director, Lee Yam Ming from Singapore, to complete a comprehensive action plan to deliver humanitarian assistance to the people of Myanmar affected by the conflict as well as the Covid-19 pandemic. The AHA Centre and Myanmar&rsquo;s Task Force under the leadership of Minister of International Cooperation, Ko Ko Hlaing, have met with the officials of AHA Center on several occasions in Nay Phy Taw and Phnom Penh.
The broadside against Asean aside, the junta leader deliberately credited three bordering countries&mdash;Thailand, China, and India&mdash;for helping the regime during times of need, which has saved many lives. Strange as it may seem, one border neighboring, Bangladesh, was not mentioned, due to the ongoing Rohingya crisis. At the moment, the Myanmar-Bangladesh ties are under stress. In the case of Russia, the junta&rsquo;s chief has no need to highlight it as it has emerged as its staunchest supporter. It was a dream come true for Moscow, which has been trying to embed itself in the heart of the Indo-Pacific, since the fall of the Soviet Union three decades ago.
Notably, the praise of the Thai humanitarian role sent a chilling effect on the Prayut government, which is facing a fresh election in the near future. Thailand is also hosting the APEC 2022 Leaders&rsquo; Meeting in November. Opposition parties and groups hostile to the current prime minister have branded him as the junta&rsquo;s main cohort. The government is currently reviewing its engagement with the SAC under the new circumstance.
The &ldquo;full description&rdquo; also made four references to her visit and activities. One key sentence that revealed the real attitude of Min Aung Hlaing towards Noeleen, can be found in the middle of the lengthy deliberation in paragraph No. 4. Somehow the senior general slipped his tongue saying that &ldquo;I do not have any personal feelings for you.&rdquo; In the Burmese culture, it was tantamount to saying that &ldquo; I do not care about you.&rdquo; That explained why the junta chief&rsquo;s temperament could swing radically from welcoming to rejecting. As such, it is now clear that after the first encounter, his feeling has turned sour and revengeful.
First, the SAC attempts to discredit her. The final paragraph No. 17 titled &ldquo;Exclusive Explanation&rdquo; blamed the special envoy&rsquo;s press statement for failure to fairly incorporate all their explanation, which &ldquo;can cause obstacles to the constructive discussions/dialogue between the two sides. Now, it is doubtful if she would be allowed to return to Myanmar.
Secondly, he also commented on her mode of transportation from Yangon to Nay Pyi Taw saying she should have taken a car instead of flying in. &ldquo;You would more realize the situation on the ground if you traveled from Yangon to Nay Phi Taw by car and looked around Yangon instead of taking the flight,&rdquo; he pointed out, adding that it is &ldquo;more appropriate to make comments about Myanmar only after realizing the real situation of the country.&rdquo;
Thirdly, the SAC wanted her and the public to know that the &ldquo;Rohingya Refugees&rdquo; do not exist. The senior general made the point because she is visiting Bangladesh in the future to discuss their plight. In Myanmar, any media using the word &ldquo;Rohingya&rdquo; would be prosecuted. The preferred term is &ldquo;Bengali.&rdquo;
Finally, Myanmar, the SAC chief reiterated, is not a newcomer to the UN as it has 75-year of history and engagement. Therefore, Noeleen did not have to give him a copy of the UN Charter. He already has gotten one.

Southeast Asia owes him for giving peace a chance during the most&nbsp;turbulent time in this part of the world. The global media has widely credited him for ending the Cold War, opening up and giving more freedom in the Soviet Union, which was unfortunate as it also brought&nbsp;down the empire and led to the establishment of newly independent states.<br /><br />During the 1980s, news about the Soviet Union often dominated the front pages of regional papers, mainly about the threats posed by communism. At the time, Moscow&#039;s relations with Indochina countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos)&nbsp;were very tight-knit both in economic and security terms. The Cold War was fiercely fought and contested in the Southeast Asian theatre. Words and moves from Moscow in relation to Southeast Asia impacted&nbsp;the general situation in all areas.</p><p>Then the wind of change came. When Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze set foot for the first time in Bangkok in March 1987, the Thai authorities were very excited by his presence. They knew that&nbsp;there would be some dramatic policy shifts in the internecine Cambodian conflict. The veteran politician from Georgia told the local media during his stopover in Bangkok that the Soviet Union was winding&nbsp;down its role in Indochina. At the same time, Moscow also announced it would also gradually pull out of Afghanistan. It was extraordinary news for the Thai public as well as Asean as a whole that one of the world&#039;s superpowers was reducing its assistance to recipients in Indochina. It would take almost two years before Gorbachev&#039;s message sunk in and it would go on to gradually kick off the peace process&nbsp;among all concerned parties with mediation from France and Australia.<br /><br />After taking power in the Soviet Union in 1985, it was clear that Gorbachev was a different kind of leader, one who wanted to create a new image and profile for his country.&nbsp;He was considered a do-gooder. As such, he also pursued a rapprochement policy to improve Soviet-US ties as the two countries were armed with thousands of nuclear warheads.&nbsp;Together, the two superpowers were able to reduce the threat of mutual destruction. In retrospect, his glasnost and perestroika policies had positive impacts on liberalising communist countries throughout&nbsp;the world, including those in Indochina.<br /><br />Obviously, the most notable impact was in Europe, which allowed the divided continent to become whole again. The fall of Berlin Wall, which exemplified the end of the Cold War, was one of his legacies. Closer to home, Gorbachev also created a conducive atmosphere for all conflicting parties in the 13-year-old civil war in Cambodia to negotiate with each other for peace.<br /><br />For this young Thai journalist, who was invited to Vladivostok on July 26, 1986 to report on Gorbachev&#039;s major foreign policy speech, it was a memorable moment as the city had long been a forbidden place.&nbsp;It took two days, crossing 11 time zones back and forth, to fly from Bangkok to Vladivostok via Moscow. (Today, one can take a six-and-a-half-hour direct flight between the two cities.) It was clear Gorbachev wanted to promote ties with Asian countries as the Soviet Union was considered both a European and Asian power.</p><p>For the Soviet Union, it was an unusual event to have members of the international media converge on this port city, which served as the naval base for the Soviet Pacific Fleet. Before Gorbachev made his&nbsp;speech, discussions among the media were focused on the so-called Soviet charm offensive. Obviously, they did so with lots of scepticism. For the five-member Asean and especially Thailand, there was a&nbsp;deep-seated mistrust of the Soviet Union because they were fighting Moscow&#039;s key allies both in the region and on the international stages including the UN.<br /><br />But after his speech was widely published and scrutinised, it was clear Moscow was indeed changing. In addressing the challenges in Southeast Asia, Gorbachev reiterated: "In our opinion, there are no insurmountable&nbsp;obstacles in the way of establishing mutually acceptable relations between the countries of Indochina and Asean. Given goodwill and on the condition of non-intervention from outside, they could solve their&nbsp;problems which would benefit the cause of security in Asia."<br /><br />That much was clear. At that time, nobody would have ever imagined that the Vladivostok speech would create a conducive atmosphere for a new Southeast Asia, which finally laid the foundation for all ten&nbsp;countries of Southeast Asia to coexist and cooperate together, as the founding fathers of Asean in 1967 had envisaged. More than the Western world would like to admit, Gorbachev had ended the region&#039;s&nbsp;East and West divide in Southeast Asia. As Asean, it has now become a beacon of peace and prosperity. Given the current major war in Europe, Asean remains a safe place place for all great powers to engage with one another, if they so decide.<br /><br /></p><p><em>This opinion piece was written by ERIA&#039;s Senior Communications Advisor, Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, and has been published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2385021/thanks-to-gorbachev-se-asia-found-peace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bangkok Post.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:75:"/uploads/news/20220906/360_f_290770929_dasdj0okyffzhevba7qmzszkgvvwtc8x.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:11405:"Thanks to Gorbachev, SE Asia Found Peace Thanks to Gorbachev, SE Asia Found Peace By Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, Senior Communications Advisor:&nbsp;Lest we forgot, President Mikhail Gorbachev was the Soviet leader who was the game changer in bringing an end to the Cambodian conflict.

Joining him were Prof Jun Arima, ERIA&rsquo;s Senior Policy Fellow for Energy, and Dr Alloysius Joko Purwanto, ERIA&rsquo;s Energy Economist.</p><p>The meeting was opened by H.E. Arifin Tasrif, Indonesia&rsquo;s Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, who emphasised the need to accelerate the clean energy transition to realise the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.</p><p>The meeting underscored the G20 energy ministers&rsquo; agreement on the Bali Common Principles for Accelerating Clean Energy Transitions (COMPACT) to achieve the climate goals. The document contains the fundamental principles for accelerating the energy transition, which will serve as the basis and reference for the G20 member nations in accelerating their energy transitions.

Joining him were Prof Jun Arima, ERIA&rsquo;s Senior Policy Fellow for Energy, and Dr Alloysius Joko Purwanto, ERIA&rsquo;s Energy Economist.
The meeting was opened by H.E. Arifin Tasrif, Indonesia&rsquo;s Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, who emphasised the need to accelerate the clean energy transition to realise the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.
The meeting underscored the G20 energy ministers&rsquo; agreement on the Bali Common Principles for Accelerating Clean Energy Transitions (COMPACT) to achieve the climate goals. The document contains the fundamental principles for accelerating the energy transition, which will serve as the basis and reference for the G20 member nations in accelerating their energy transitions. The energy minister said that the Bali COMPACT encapsulates a comprehensive approach to the pledge to achieve net zero emissions, including near-term mitigation strategy to combat climate change by accelerating transition to clean energy.
Minister Tasrif pointed out the significance of the G20 agenda in the context of the global leadership responsibility of addressing the current and growing energy needs, particularly of developing countries, where facilitating and ensuring equitable, inclusive, and sustainable transitions are based on the pillars of economic development and resiliency.
This year&rsquo;s ETMM focused on the global economy and energy outlook, and accelerating the energy transition, including access, financing, and technology. The meeting emphasised that coordination on policies amongst G20 countries is imperative to strengthen cooperation to make sure that the energy transition agenda and enhancing energy security will move forward. G20 members were asked to make energy systems more resilient and future-proof and consider varied pathways and national conditions to ensure that no one is left behind.
The ETMM was closed by the third session where the G20 countries discussed the Communique chaired by HE Arifin Tasrif.             2022-09-02 2 September 2022 2202 rebmetpeS 2 20-90-2202             .firsaT nifirA EH yb deriahc euqinummoC eht dessucsid seirtnuoc 02G eht erehw noisses driht eht yb desolc saw MMTE ehT

Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, Director for&nbsp; Strategy and Partnership of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) , presented the &nbsp;findings of the research carried out under the E-S-I Knowledge Lab. &nbsp;She said the support needed by high-growth small firms is extremely different from that needed by traditional and less productive micro firms. She said some entrepreneurs have more difficulties than others in benefitting from the digital economy, including women, those in rural areas where digital connectivity is less accessible, or people with disability. Dr Marsan discussed the important partnerships amongst government, business, and educational institutions in the development and implementation of policy approaches.
Other speakers included Mr Michael Bak of Meta, Mr Luke Tay of Cornucipia FuturesScapes, and Dr Chao-Chiun Liang of the Industrial Technology Research Institute of Chinese Taipei.             2022-09-05 5 September 2022 2202 rebmetpeS 5 50-90-2202             .iepiaT esenihC fo etutitsnI hcraeseR ygolonhceT lairtsudnI eht fo gnaiL nuihC-oahC rD dna ,sepacSserutuF aipicunroC fo yaT ekuL rM ,ateM fo kaB leahciM rM dedulcni srekaeps rehtO

Dr Lili Yan Ing, ERIA&rsquo;s Lead Advisor for Southeast Asia Region participated in the T20 panel discussion session chaired by Prof Suhono Harso Supangkat, Task Force 2 Lead Co-Chair, themed &lsquo;Leveraging Digital Transformation and Smartization to Improve Quality of Life&rsquo; along with Prof Dennis J. Snower, President of Global Solutions Initiative, Dr Mansi Kedia, Research Fellow at ICRIER, and Prof Toshio Obi, Co-Chair of Task Force 2 T20 Indonesia.</p><p>Dr Yayan Ganda Hayat Mulyana, Head of Secretariat of Foreign Policy Strategy Agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Indonesia gave his keynote speech before the panel discussion. &lsquo;An estimated 37% of the world&rsquo;s population or 2.9 billion do not have internet access, of 2.9 billion offline an estimated 96% live in developing countries. There is urgency to reduce digital disparity, particularly for developing nations,&rsquo; Highlighted by Dr Mulyana. Dr Mulyana mentioned key messages: (1) it is important to develop local capacity to ensure the digital transformation; (2) improve the digital literacy in developing countries; (3) continuously put efforts on harmonizing global health protocol standards through an integrated digital health; (4) digital safety as digitalization carries automation risk and data privacy risk.</p><p>The panel session discussed how to increase the distribution of high-quality and affordable global internet access connectivity, digital literacy and skills, and technology adoption through digital transformation and smartization, as well as the creativity and collaboration of diverse individuals, governments, and the private sector to enhance the quality of life. The most important part in sustainable development is the quality of life as well as the goal of ICT development is to improve society&rsquo;s welfare. However, challenges such as disparate incomes, low digital literacy, and geographical conditions creates ICT application, development, and global connectivity difficult.</p><p>On the panel session, Prof Dennis J. Snower highlighted the importance of reducing the digital divide and providing digital literacy protecting privacy and cybersecurity. Prof Snower mentioned that enhancing digital literacy goes beyond education and training. We also need to take into account that over the past decade, it is not only the digital divide grown but also the cybersecurity threats have grown. Prof Snower concluded with his remark about the quality of life through GDP where the digital age has managed to generate a reasonable amount of GDP. However, the GDP growth is still very unequally distributed, and it makes us blind to two important aspects of digital life that we inhabit, one is social solidarity, and the second is the societal of social creation is agency.</p><p>Dr Lili Yan Ing then continued the panel discussion by highlighting that digital transformation improved productivity and trade. Technological advances can work faster and in greater precision and accuracy.

Dr Lili Yan Ing, ERIA&rsquo;s Lead Advisor for Southeast Asia Region participated in the T20 panel discussion session chaired by Prof Suhono Harso Supangkat, Task Force 2 Lead Co-Chair, themed &lsquo;Leveraging Digital Transformation and Smartization to Improve Quality of Life&rsquo; along with Prof Dennis J. Snower, President of Global Solutions Initiative, Dr Mansi Kedia, Research Fellow at ICRIER, and Prof Toshio Obi, Co-Chair of Task Force 2 T20 Indonesia.
Dr Yayan Ganda Hayat Mulyana, Head of Secretariat of Foreign Policy Strategy Agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Indonesia gave his keynote speech before the panel discussion. &lsquo;An estimated 37% of the world&rsquo;s population or 2.9 billion do not have internet access, of 2.9 billion offline an estimated 96% live in developing countries. There is urgency to reduce digital disparity, particularly for developing nations,&rsquo; Highlighted by Dr Mulyana. Dr Mulyana mentioned key messages: (1) it is important to develop local capacity to ensure the digital transformation; (2) improve the digital literacy in developing countries; (3) continuously put efforts on harmonizing global health protocol standards through an integrated digital health; (4) digital safety as digitalization carries automation risk and data privacy risk.
The panel session discussed how to increase the distribution of high-quality and affordable global internet access connectivity, digital literacy and skills, and technology adoption through digital transformation and smartization, as well as the creativity and collaboration of diverse individuals, governments, and the private sector to enhance the quality of life. The most important part in sustainable development is the quality of life as well as the goal of ICT development is to improve society&rsquo;s welfare. However, challenges such as disparate incomes, low digital literacy, and geographical conditions creates ICT application, development, and global connectivity difficult.
On the panel session, Prof Dennis J. Snower highlighted the importance of reducing the digital divide and providing digital literacy protecting privacy and cybersecurity. Prof Snower mentioned that enhancing digital literacy goes beyond education and training. We also need to take into account that over the past decade, it is not only the digital divide grown but also the cybersecurity threats have grown. Prof Snower concluded with his remark about the quality of life through GDP where the digital age has managed to generate a reasonable amount of GDP. However, the GDP growth is still very unequally distributed, and it makes us blind to two important aspects of digital life that we inhabit, one is social solidarity, and the second is the societal of social creation is agency.
Dr Lili Yan Ing then continued the panel discussion by highlighting that digital transformation improved productivity and trade. Technological advances can work faster and in greater precision and accuracy. Industrial robots and AI can also help markets to function more efficiently that lead to improvisation of human welfare overall. &lsquo;However, it is important to note that digital transformation also raises inequality in two ways, displacement effects and premature deindustrialization effects. On top of inequality issues, the world faces several challenges in digital transformation and digital trade: privacy, cybersecurity, competition, and digital divide,&rsquo; Highlighted by Dr Ing.
As policy recommendations, Dr Ing addressed four important dimensions of the challenges posed by DX that the G20 might seek to address during Indonesia&rsquo;s presidency of the group: first, the G20 needs to implement what it has already committed to in the fields of industrial robots, automation, and AI; second, G20 members should cooperate to promote incentives for technological adoption by developing countries to reduce the adoption cost of industrial robots, automation, and AI for businesses and to make these technologies commercially viable; third, the G20 should improve the quality of key digital enablers for the adoption of industrial robots, automation and AI; and finally, Dr Ing emphasized &lsquo;the work of implementing and adapting to the massive changes that go along with DX falls on human capital. The G20 should continue to promote efforts to improve preparedness for digital and AI technologies, both amongst the workforce and firms (especially MSMEs, women, and youth) to reduce the digital divide and to promote more inclusive digital participation.&rsquo; Therefore, it is crucial for the G20 to further facilitate partnership between the private and public sectors to raise the pool of funds that can be used to reduce digital gaps and improve digital skills worldwide to ensure &lsquo;development for all&rsquo;.
The discussion continued with remarks from Dr Mansi Kedia that focused on digital literacy. Dr Kedia highlighted that the common understanding of digital literacy is the ability to live, work and learn in a society where communication and access to information increasingly through digital technologies. But it also means knowing limitations of technology and understanding the dangers and precautions. One of the key challenges of digital literacy according to Dr Kedia is that most digital literacy programs fail to address women&rsquo;s social and cultural challenges especially in developing countries. Thus, the G20 needs to identify common measurable indicators of digital literacy. &lsquo;As technology involves, the skill requirement will change, then digital literacy indicators must be dynamic. The G20 also needs to adopt gender specific targets and monitor progress,&rsquo; according to Dr Kedia.
Finally, the last remark was given by Prof Toshio Obi. Prof Obi mentioned some policy recommendations to the T20 on the digital transformation: (1) it is important for the G20 to reduce regulatory problems; (2) countries need to promote meaningful digitalization through cross-sectional collaboration in digital innovation. It is also important to develop smart cities or digital government in this digital age; (3) we need to close the digital divide, particularly for MSMEs, in order to support them to improve quality of life.             2022-09-05 5 September 2022 2202 rebmetpeS 5 50-90-2202             .efil fo ytilauq evorpmi ot meht troppus ot redro ni ,sEMSM rof ylralucitrap ,edivid latigid eht esolc ot deen ew )3( ;ega latigid siht ni tnemnrevog latigid ro seitic trams poleved ot tnatropmi osla si tI .noitavonni latigid ni noitaroballoc lanoitces-ssorc hguorht noitazilatigid lufgninaem etomorp ot deen seirtnuoc )2( ;smelborp yrotaluger ecuder ot 02G eht rof tnatropmi si ti )1( :noitamrofsnart latigid eht no 02T eht ot snoitadnemmocer ycilop emos denoitnem ibO forP .ibO oihsoT forP yb nevig saw kramer tsal eht ,yllaniF

As a result, the supply of energy could not catch up with robust resilient demand recovery. There is an ongoing mismatch of supply and continuous, more responsive, and elastic energy demand. Second, the situation was exacerbated afterwards by further elevated energy price levels and volatility.

The energy landscape has significantly changed since the onset of the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine. Prior to the conflict, climate action was at the centre of the energy debate with a range of ideas about how to increase renewable energy and reduce the use of fossil fuels. However, with energy prices further escalating due to the conflict and growing concerns about crude oil and natural gas supply shortages, interest in energy security has rapidly climbed to the top of the agenda. Investments in fossil fuels are essential to resolving the ongoing energy security crisis, creating a stark contradiction to long-term climate action.

Addressing this issue is essential for the economic growth of Asian countries. This hybrid workshop was organised with experts from Asia and other regions to discuss these challenges from multiple perspectives.
The workshop started with opening remarks by Prof Tutuka Ariadji, Director General, Directorate General of Oil and Gas, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), Indonesia and Prof Hidetoshi Nishimura, President of ERIA followed by welcome remarks by Dr Siti Indati binti Mustapa, Director of Institute of Energy Policy and Research, Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), Malaysia and Co-Chairperson of ERIN and special keynote speeches by Prof Masakazu Toyoda, Senior Advisor of the Institute of Energy Economics Japan (IEEJ), Japan and Mr Prahoro Yulianto Nurtjahyo, Co-chair of the G20 Energy Transition Working Group, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Indonesia, Co-chairperson of the G20 Energy Transition Working Group (ETWG).
Session 1, moderated by Prof Basil M.H. Sharp, Professor, Chair in Energy Economics, Department of Economics, Faculty of Business and Economics, The University of Auckland (UoA), discussed the implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on short to mid-term energy security. Session 2, moderated by Moderated by Dr Asclepias Rachmi Soerjono Indriyanto, Chairperson of Executive Board, Indonesian Institute for Energy Economics (IIEE), Indonesia discussed how to align climate action with energy security in the EAS region. Session 3, moderated by Dr Siti Indati binti Mustapa, discussed necessary policies and initiatives for energy security and climate action in the EAS region following background presentation by Prof Tatsuya Terazawa, Chairman and CEO of IEEJ, Japan.
After the three panel sessions, the following key points were extracted;

The global debate on decarbonization should recognize different circumstances between OECD countries and non-OECD (in particular Asian) developing countries. Asian countries should speak out more.
Asian Countries have increased electricity demand to achieve their economic growths, thus accessible, available, and affordable electricity from thermal power plants will be necessary continuously in future.
Thus, gas will take on an increasingly large role in the low carbon energy transition (coal to gas) and it will be a most probable pathway in Asia.
However, current gas price hikes due to the Ukraine crisis could delay fuel switching from coal to natural gas.
Limiting oil and gas consumption and shifting to affordable renewable energy (e.g. PV) is necessary.
At the same time, given that fossil fuel will remain part of the energy mix, all options for reducing CO2 from fossil fuel use should be pursued starting with co-firing hydrogen and ammonia and then CCS.
In parallel, oil and gas upstream investment is necessary with win-win solutions for oil and gas producers and consumers. Consequently, transparency of gas prices in the Asian and global markets will also be maintained.
With a view to achieving the ultimate decarbonization around mid-century, investment in decarbonisation technology development will also be necessary.
In addition, the international framework to facilitate decarbonisation technology transfer from OECD to Asian countries will be indispensable.

After the three panel sessions, Mr Koji Hachiyama, CEO of ERIA, closed the 7th ERIN workshop, emphasizing ERIA&rsquo;s continuous support of ERIN activities and contribution to new energy issues for balanced energy security and climate actions.

Six renowned experts from and a senior economist from ERIA were invited to speak and share best practices on smoothly handling and exiting the ongoing pandemic, and prepare for upcoming ones. A second webcast is scheduled for October.</p><p>For the past 2.5 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed health systems and embattled economies across the globe. Within the ERIA Member States (EMS)&nbsp;alone, a host of measures have been introduced and implemented to balance each nation&rsquo;s health and economy.</p><p>Opening the conference, Dr Songheang Ai, Director of the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organisation Regional Centre for Technical Education Development in Cambodia, expressed the need for regional unity through sharing of national approaches. He cited Cambodia&rsquo;s efforts in handling the pandemic, which included vaccinations and emphasising social welfare.</p><p>Prof Tjandra Yoga Aditama, former Director of Communicable Diseases of the Southeast Asia Regional Office of the World Health Organization&rsquo; (WHO) &nbsp;in Indonesia, provided a history of recent pandemics, connecting previous global learning experiences to the current pandemic and noting the importance of continued vigilance and better preparation. Regarding preparation, he shared a WHO framework consisting of five approaches: vaccination, public health, and social measures with community involvement; clinical care and resilient health systems; research and development with equitable access; surveillance and laboratory activities; and COVID-19 response coordination. He mentioned Indonesia&rsquo;s President Joko Widodo&rsquo;s support to international strategies through the country&rsquo;s 2022 G20 presidency, as well as the country&rsquo;s strategy &lsquo;to establish highest-level national coordination for pandemic preparedness and response&rsquo;. He said Indonesia&rsquo;s COVID-19 National Task Force has emphasised pandemic control with economic recovery through vaccination coverage, monitoring of the national health situation, and economic recovery. He concluded that beyond centralised emergency programmes, the new normal will require more attention to healthy lifestyles and preventive measures in Universal Health Coverage and Industry 5.0 through deeper community ownership.</p><p>In terms of COVID-19 strategies in the Philippines, Dr Maria Rosario Singh-Vergeire, of the Department of Health, presented health statistics showing that post-Delta wave and post-Omicron peak number of cases had fallen to triple digits daily whilst hospital bed utilisation rates fell as well to about 16%, with 11% of COVID-19 admissions being severe. Dr Vergeire shared the &nbsp;&ndash;integrated PDITR+ strategy, which represents a continuous prevent-detect-isolate-treat-reintegrate course and includes a national vaccination programme. She said PDITR+ adheres to the 4-door strategy against emerging and infectious diseases, the doors being point of origin, point of entry, point of care, and community. She noted that improvements during the pandemic have included a strong awareness campaign, an increase in testing and surveillance laboratories from 17 to 334, price caps for tests, a growing telemedicine industry, home care and community access infrastructure, coordinated information sharing, capacity building of sequencing facilities, and digital transformation (i.e., electronic data records, cloud analytics, disease models). She expressed the need for long-term investments and sustainable partnerships. Amongst the economic benefits of these efforts, she said, has been a decrease in overall national hospital expenditures as a result of decreased admissions.</p><p>Prof Prasit Watanapa, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital at Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand, announced the establishment of the Centre of COVID-19 Situation Administration, a unit composed of representatives from public and private sectors set up to initiate policy that prioritises health, economy, and public and society as components of national security. Thus, he said, the centre first focused on the vulnerable people persuading the public to be vaccinated. Economically, it offered debt restructuring in general, gave a 50% food subsidy to the low-income population, and extended soft loans (a total of 250 billion baht) to support businesses as restrictions were gradually eased. He said that Thailand&rsquo;s strategies have been effective primarily because of good cooperation amongst the government, business operators, and business recipients.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dr Vijay Murali,&nbsp;COVID-19 Task Force and India&rsquo;s Ministry of Health national awardee for pandemic management, disclosed that India, being a vaccine manufacturer and information technology developer, focused on vaccinations through the digital COVID Vaccination Intelligence Network programme and software application. The software contains five independent modules: orchestration, cold chain, citizen registration, vaccinators, and feedback with a real-time dashboard used by manufacturers, healthcare workers, and private citizens. He reported that throughout the pandemic, India has established hospital core COVID-19 control, integrated and coordinated available resources with hospital facilities and supply chains for medicines, educated the population on the social responsibility of maintaining health, and led smartly through teamwork. He said that a digitalised vaccination programme, proper screening, and triage have been effective in reducing healthcare facility burdens and that it is important to consider interdisciplinary approaches, alongside and new scientific collaborations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dr Norio Ohmagari, Head of the COVID-19 Task Force and Director of Disease Control and Prevention Center of the &nbsp;National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo, Japan, discussed the relationship between infection prevention control and the social system in Japan. He said the Japanese Government cannot restrict nor mandate but only request the citizenry to comply with recommendations. He remarked that the lockdowns are voluntary and that the government has focused on risk communication, particularly the 3 Cs to avoid: close contacts, crowded areas, and closed spaces. Thereafter, he said, compliance depends on individual choices.

Six renowned experts from and a senior economist from ERIA were invited to speak and share best practices on smoothly handling and exiting the ongoing pandemic, and prepare for upcoming ones. A second webcast is scheduled for October.
For the past 2.5 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed health systems and embattled economies across the globe. Within the ERIA Member States (EMS)&nbsp;alone, a host of measures have been introduced and implemented to balance each nation&rsquo;s health and economy.
Opening the conference, Dr Songheang Ai, Director of the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organisation Regional Centre for Technical Education Development in Cambodia, expressed the need for regional unity through sharing of national approaches. He cited Cambodia&rsquo;s efforts in handling the pandemic, which included vaccinations and emphasising social welfare.
Prof Tjandra Yoga Aditama, former Director of Communicable Diseases of the Southeast Asia Regional Office of the World Health Organization&rsquo; (WHO) &nbsp;in Indonesia, provided a history of recent pandemics, connecting previous global learning experiences to the current pandemic and noting the importance of continued vigilance and better preparation. Regarding preparation, he shared a WHO framework consisting of five approaches: vaccination, public health, and social measures with community involvement; clinical care and resilient health systems; research and development with equitable access; surveillance and laboratory activities; and COVID-19 response coordination. He mentioned Indonesia&rsquo;s President Joko Widodo&rsquo;s support to international strategies through the country&rsquo;s 2022 G20 presidency, as well as the country&rsquo;s strategy &lsquo;to establish highest-level national coordination for pandemic preparedness and response&rsquo;. He said Indonesia&rsquo;s COVID-19 National Task Force has emphasised pandemic control with economic recovery through vaccination coverage, monitoring of the national health situation, and economic recovery. He concluded that beyond centralised emergency programmes, the new normal will require more attention to healthy lifestyles and preventive measures in Universal Health Coverage and Industry 5.0 through deeper community ownership.
In terms of COVID-19 strategies in the Philippines, Dr Maria Rosario Singh-Vergeire, of the Department of Health, presented health statistics showing that post-Delta wave and post-Omicron peak number of cases had fallen to triple digits daily whilst hospital bed utilisation rates fell as well to about 16%, with 11% of COVID-19 admissions being severe. Dr Vergeire shared the &nbsp;&ndash;integrated PDITR+ strategy, which represents a continuous prevent-detect-isolate-treat-reintegrate course and includes a national vaccination programme. She said PDITR+ adheres to the 4-door strategy against emerging and infectious diseases, the doors being point of origin, point of entry, point of care, and community. She noted that improvements during the pandemic have included a strong awareness campaign, an increase in testing and surveillance laboratories from 17 to 334, price caps for tests, a growing telemedicine industry, home care and community access infrastructure, coordinated information sharing, capacity building of sequencing facilities, and digital transformation (i.e., electronic data records, cloud analytics, disease models). She expressed the need for long-term investments and sustainable partnerships. Amongst the economic benefits of these efforts, she said, has been a decrease in overall national hospital expenditures as a result of decreased admissions.
Prof Prasit Watanapa, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital at Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand, announced the establishment of the Centre of COVID-19 Situation Administration, a unit composed of representatives from public and private sectors set up to initiate policy that prioritises health, economy, and public and society as components of national security. Thus, he said, the centre first focused on the vulnerable people persuading the public to be vaccinated. Economically, it offered debt restructuring in general, gave a 50% food subsidy to the low-income population, and extended soft loans (a total of 250 billion baht) to support businesses as restrictions were gradually eased. He said that Thailand&rsquo;s strategies have been effective primarily because of good cooperation amongst the government, business operators, and business recipients.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dr Vijay Murali,&nbsp;COVID-19 Task Force and India&rsquo;s Ministry of Health national awardee for pandemic management, disclosed that India, being a vaccine manufacturer and information technology developer, focused on vaccinations through the digital COVID Vaccination Intelligence Network programme and software application. The software contains five independent modules: orchestration, cold chain, citizen registration, vaccinators, and feedback with a real-time dashboard used by manufacturers, healthcare workers, and private citizens. He reported that throughout the pandemic, India has established hospital core COVID-19 control, integrated and coordinated available resources with hospital facilities and supply chains for medicines, educated the population on the social responsibility of maintaining health, and led smartly through teamwork. He said that a digitalised vaccination programme, proper screening, and triage have been effective in reducing healthcare facility burdens and that it is important to consider interdisciplinary approaches, alongside and new scientific collaborations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dr Norio Ohmagari, Head of the COVID-19 Task Force and Director of Disease Control and Prevention Center of the &nbsp;National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo, Japan, discussed the relationship between infection prevention control and the social system in Japan. He said the Japanese Government cannot restrict nor mandate but only request the citizenry to comply with recommendations. He remarked that the lockdowns are voluntary and that the government has focused on risk communication, particularly the 3 Cs to avoid: close contacts, crowded areas, and closed spaces. Thereafter, he said, compliance depends on individual choices. Although pandemic mental health has become a concern, he said that &lsquo;society must become resilient&rsquo; whilst stimulating economic activity by minimising deaths and the number of people that require hospitalisation. He warned that if infection control measures are relaxed suddenly, many will be infected. &nbsp;&nbsp;
ERIA&rsquo;s Senior Economist Dr Aladdin Rillo apprised the participants of the ASEAN economic situation, describing the pandemic as a global health and economic crisis that for the past 2 years has impacted the productive capacity of nations. He presented the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework &lsquo;from containment to recovery&rsquo;, which highlights the equal importance of health and economy through five components: enhancing health systems, strengthening human security, maximising the potential of an intra-ASEAN market, accelerating digitalisation, and advancing a sustainable and resilient future.

He concluded that ASEAN requires more discussion on how to manage trade-offs between economy and health and how to implement dynamic rather than restrictive policies to better serve the region.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
During the question-and-answer portion, Dean Prasit was asked about the safety and efficacy of vaccines amongst the Thai population. He responded that all types of vaccines are safe although he noted some concerns about long-term effects of mRNA types. He said that all types of vaccines are available in Thailand.
Asked under what conditions the Philippines would consider locking down international travel again, Dr Vergeire answered that the Philippines and other nations have observed that locking down borders is not a sustainable strategy for health and the economy. Rather, she said, the Philippines will continue to use the 4-door strategy that has been effective so far. Still, she added, an alert system is in place that sets of an alarm when incoming travellers introduce infections in the country.
Asked on how nations can make businesses more resilient against future pandemics and if current innovations have proven fruitful and sustainable, Prof Tjandra commented that businesses have adapted to work from office, work from home, and work from anywhere, practices that can continue post-pandemic. He noted five points: architecture or the importance of good ventilation in buildings, touchscreens on doors, elevators, etc.; physical distancing in spaces such as lifts; video communications for intensive care unit visitors; cashless transactions; and Industry 4.0/5.0 digitalisation such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and so on.
Asked about the recent rise of Omicron cases in Japan, Dr Ohmagari, answered that, fortunately, the percentage of Omicron patients requiring admission has been quite small. Society, however, needs to accept or tolerate large numbers of cases whilst the healthcare system practices &lsquo;to-the-point&rsquo; or targeted measures to minimise hospitalisation.
Dr Vijay answered in the negative when asked if India is accepting post-COVID-19 medical certificates in lieu of vaccination certificates for travel. He said that because immunity has not yet been established, vaccinations are provided even after infection.
Asked if there is a regional mechanism to achieve the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, Dr Rillo mentioned two modalities: through the ASEAN Coordinating Committee on Public Health Emergencies, and through the strong comprehensive monitoring framework by the ASEAN Secretariat.

At this juncture, the time is right. Both countries are planning to commemorate the 190th anniversary of their diplomatic relations next year. Across the world, the war in Ukraine has already generating long-term regional repercussions, helping to highlight the state of the Thai-US alliance.</p><p>According to private conversations with both retired and on-duty senior military officials, the recent surge of visits by senior US officials including US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Indo-Pacific Command (Indopacom) Commander Adm John Aquilino reflects Washington&#039;s desire for closer ties with Thailand. Although this objective has been around since the Cold War, it has been neglected over the past few decades due to the lack of common security threats after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p><p>The first and most important development has to be the unintended consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It has suddenly placed Thailand in a central strategic position not only for the US&#039;s global strategies but those of Europe as well. The country is centred between the battlefields in Central Europe and the current Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. Judging from past experience, especially during numerous conflicts in the Middle East, any additional logistical support and access, especially equipment and supplies from Indopacom, would need to go through Thailand. The U-Tapao airbase and Sattahip naval base have long been the most useful hubs, although of late there have been discussions about alternative sites.</p><p>After the joint Thailand-US Strategic and Defence Dialogue in Washington in May, the alliance has been reinvigorated. The US has not only restored the International Military Education and Training (Imet) programme abut also increased its budget for Thai army officers at a value of US$2.68 million (94.7 million baht) this year. Imet allows young Thai military officers to learn with the American and other international colleagues. Most importantly, it is aimed at creating a good rapport between young Thai and US officials which has been missing for nearly two decades. Both visits by Mr Austin and Adm Aquilino to Bangkok were highly symbolic but they were significant in demonstrating the Biden administration&#039;s commitment that from now on Thailand is in its global strategic loop.</p><p>Furthermore, it has been Washington&#039;s desire to build an "integrated deterrence" against the rise of US adversaries in the region. Obviously, both China and Russia are on the list. With existing allies in the Indo-Pacific, the US wants to maximise Thailand&#039;s assets in terms of location and its regional ecosystem.</p><p>In Washington&#039;s perspective, Thailand has maintained good ties with all its neighboring countries. Most importantly, the country has good connectivity both on the ground and in space. It is interesting to note that for the first time, both sides have discussed their cooperation in space. The war in Europe has shown the latent potential of cyberspace security and specific satellite-linked technology during a time of conflict. Details of such cooperation have yet to be worked out.</p><p>Furthermore, the normalisation of Thai-Saudi Arabian relations, which had been proceeding under the media&#039;s antennae since 2018, was another contributing factor. However, it was the meeting between Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, who served as the Asean chair at the G20 summit in Japan that got the ball rolling. It was in Osaka, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai, that the bond of friendship between the Saudi prince and the Thai leader was born. They discussed their daily lives and how to keep themselves fit, among other subjects. The normalisation could have started earlier but domestic developments in both countries delayed the process. After the normalisation on Jan 6, the rest has been history.</p><p>Thai-Saudi ties must be viewed in a global strategic context. For three decades, Thailand, a key US ally, was completely absent from Washington&#039;s Middle East policy circuit. Strained ties with Riyadh also impacted Thailand&#039;s ties with other members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation despite assistance from friendly countries. As such, it impeded US broader counter-terrorism efforts. In addition, improved ties between Thailand and Iran in the past years have worried Washington as the former also depends on the latter&#039;s imported oil. Iran&#039;s growing influence in the region has further dented Riyadh&#039;s sphere of influence.</p><p>Indeed, energy security has been the Prayut government&#039;s top priority. Normalised ties with Saudi Arabia have eased energy-shortage concerns and lessened the dependence on imported energy from Myanmar. If Myanmar&#039;s situation remains unchanged, there could be energy sanctions which would hurt Thailand. Currently, both Bangkok and Riyadh are doing everything to return to normalcy without a minute&#039;s delay. Commercial flights between the two capitals have resumed and normal trade has resumed with new investment deals signed. Trade delegations have already exchanged visits. New ambassadors from both countries have been named.</p><p>In between the visits of Adm Aquilino and Mr Austin, there was the low-profile visit of US Department of State Counsellor Derek Chollet, whose sole purposes was to learn first-hand about the Myanmar quagmire. Mr Chollet&#039;s visit was extremely significant as he is the key person in the Biden administration handling Myanmar. His discussions with Thailand&#039;s special envoy to Myanmar Pornpimol Kanchanalak and visits to the Thai-Myanmar frontier helped him to understand the complexity of the crisis in Myanmar. They discussed internal dynamics, local displaced persons and most importantly, as a neighbour of Myanmar, Thailand having to share the burden of the consequences of the conflict along its 2401-kilometre border. Thailand&#039;s relations with armed ethnic organisations such as the Karen, Shan, Kayah and others are peaceful, making future humanitarian assistance less troublesome.</p><p>With the planned second visit tomorrow of Asean special envoy and Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn to Myanmar, a clearer plan for humanitarian aid is expected. Thailand will play an important role in this operation along with the Asean Coordinating Center for Humanitarian and Disaster Management which will include vaccinations and the distribution of medical and food aid along the border and adjacent areas. The Thai Red-Cross Society will serve as a local partner.</p><p>During his visit, Mr Chollet made clear that the US strongly supports the Asean five-point consensus (5PC), but at the same time pressure is mounting among US lawmakers to give more support to the National Unity Government, or NUG -- the government in exile. The same is true within Asean. Frustration among certain Asean members is equally high as the 5PC has made marginal progress.

At this juncture, the time is right. Both countries are planning to commemorate the 190th anniversary of their diplomatic relations next year. Across the world, the war in Ukraine has already generating long-term regional repercussions, helping to highlight the state of the Thai-US alliance.
According to private conversations with both retired and on-duty senior military officials, the recent surge of visits by senior US officials including US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Indo-Pacific Command (Indopacom) Commander Adm John Aquilino reflects Washington's desire for closer ties with Thailand. Although this objective has been around since the Cold War, it has been neglected over the past few decades due to the lack of common security threats after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The first and most important development has to be the unintended consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It has suddenly placed Thailand in a central strategic position not only for the US's global strategies but those of Europe as well. The country is centred between the battlefields in Central Europe and the current Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. Judging from past experience, especially during numerous conflicts in the Middle East, any additional logistical support and access, especially equipment and supplies from Indopacom, would need to go through Thailand. The U-Tapao airbase and Sattahip naval base have long been the most useful hubs, although of late there have been discussions about alternative sites.
After the joint Thailand-US Strategic and Defence Dialogue in Washington in May, the alliance has been reinvigorated. The US has not only restored the International Military Education and Training (Imet) programme abut also increased its budget for Thai army officers at a value of US$2.68 million (94.7 million baht) this year. Imet allows young Thai military officers to learn with the American and other international colleagues. Most importantly, it is aimed at creating a good rapport between young Thai and US officials which has been missing for nearly two decades. Both visits by Mr Austin and Adm Aquilino to Bangkok were highly symbolic but they were significant in demonstrating the Biden administration's commitment that from now on Thailand is in its global strategic loop.
Furthermore, it has been Washington's desire to build an "integrated deterrence" against the rise of US adversaries in the region. Obviously, both China and Russia are on the list. With existing allies in the Indo-Pacific, the US wants to maximise Thailand's assets in terms of location and its regional ecosystem.
In Washington's perspective, Thailand has maintained good ties with all its neighboring countries. Most importantly, the country has good connectivity both on the ground and in space. It is interesting to note that for the first time, both sides have discussed their cooperation in space. The war in Europe has shown the latent potential of cyberspace security and specific satellite-linked technology during a time of conflict. Details of such cooperation have yet to be worked out.
Furthermore, the normalisation of Thai-Saudi Arabian relations, which had been proceeding under the media's antennae since 2018, was another contributing factor. However, it was the meeting between Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, who served as the Asean chair at the G20 summit in Japan that got the ball rolling. It was in Osaka, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai, that the bond of friendship between the Saudi prince and the Thai leader was born. They discussed their daily lives and how to keep themselves fit, among other subjects. The normalisation could have started earlier but domestic developments in both countries delayed the process. After the normalisation on Jan 6, the rest has been history.
Thai-Saudi ties must be viewed in a global strategic context. For three decades, Thailand, a key US ally, was completely absent from Washington's Middle East policy circuit. Strained ties with Riyadh also impacted Thailand's ties with other members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation despite assistance from friendly countries. As such, it impeded US broader counter-terrorism efforts. In addition, improved ties between Thailand and Iran in the past years have worried Washington as the former also depends on the latter's imported oil. Iran's growing influence in the region has further dented Riyadh's sphere of influence.
Indeed, energy security has been the Prayut government's top priority. Normalised ties with Saudi Arabia have eased energy-shortage concerns and lessened the dependence on imported energy from Myanmar. If Myanmar's situation remains unchanged, there could be energy sanctions which would hurt Thailand. Currently, both Bangkok and Riyadh are doing everything to return to normalcy without a minute's delay. Commercial flights between the two capitals have resumed and normal trade has resumed with new investment deals signed. Trade delegations have already exchanged visits. New ambassadors from both countries have been named.
In between the visits of Adm Aquilino and Mr Austin, there was the low-profile visit of US Department of State Counsellor Derek Chollet, whose sole purposes was to learn first-hand about the Myanmar quagmire. Mr Chollet's visit was extremely significant as he is the key person in the Biden administration handling Myanmar. His discussions with Thailand's special envoy to Myanmar Pornpimol Kanchanalak and visits to the Thai-Myanmar frontier helped him to understand the complexity of the crisis in Myanmar. They discussed internal dynamics, local displaced persons and most importantly, as a neighbour of Myanmar, Thailand having to share the burden of the consequences of the conflict along its 2401-kilometre border. Thailand's relations with armed ethnic organisations such as the Karen, Shan, Kayah and others are peaceful, making future humanitarian assistance less troublesome.
With the planned second visit tomorrow of Asean special envoy and Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn to Myanmar, a clearer plan for humanitarian aid is expected. Thailand will play an important role in this operation along with the Asean Coordinating Center for Humanitarian and Disaster Management which will include vaccinations and the distribution of medical and food aid along the border and adjacent areas. The Thai Red-Cross Society will serve as a local partner.
During his visit, Mr Chollet made clear that the US strongly supports the Asean five-point consensus (5PC), but at the same time pressure is mounting among US lawmakers to give more support to the National Unity Government, or NUG -- the government in exile. The same is true within Asean. Frustration among certain Asean members is equally high as the 5PC has made marginal progress. There could be a knock-out effect on Asean's overall handling of Myanmar if there is no substantial progress in the visit by Prak Sokhonn to Myanmar. The Cambodian chair will last roughly another 167 days before the incoming chair, Indonesia, takes over in November. The window to implement the 5PC is narrowing for the State Administrative Council, as the military junta is officially known.
In addition, the US needs Thailand as an economic partner. As the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia, it is important for the US to hook up with Thailand. US is the country's third-largest investor and its second-largest trading partner. When the US approached Thailand about the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (Ipef), Washington was not certain that Bangkok would be willing to be one of the founding signatories. Much to the surprise of the White House and the diplomatic community, Thailand joined the Ipef and 13 others, much to the chagrin of the opposition parties. This time it was the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which made this strategic decision. Previously, Thailand had been recalcitrant even in expressing an intention to negotiate to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans Pacific Partnership. Truth be told, Bangkok's decision has won plaudits in Washington, adding value to the rejuvenated Thailand-US alliance. Once again, Thailand is on the US radar.
Finally, there is Thailand's attempts to firm up its balancing wheel status in the fast-moving global strategic landscape. As the host of the Asia Pacific Economic Leaders' Meeting this November, Bangkok will have to use all of its statecraft to manage the 21 economies which have different views and preferences despite having common trade and investment goals. As the Apec trade ministerial meeting showed, the ripple effects of the Russian-Ukraine war cannot be underestimated. At the meeting, there was no joint statement and six Apec members came out with their own statement condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The host does not want the same thing to be repeated at the summit.
At the very least, Thailand wants to make sure that at the Apec Summit during the third week of November, the rivalry between the US and China will be less feisty. After all, Thailand is a safe place for both superpowers to sort out their differences and ameliorate their ties. The stakes for Thailand are very high as it will be the first official visit to Bangkok by President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping. It will be sooner rather than later before we will be able to see whether its centuries-old diplomatic finesse can get Thailand through all these conundrums.
All the conspiratorial talk and hearsay aside, like other smaller countries, Thailand has to navigate its foreign policy meticulously at this juncture as hostile intentions and forces are looming large in the background. A misstep could tilt the balance that its diplomatic norms have nurtured for generations.

It was his first meeting with a dignitary from Asean though he had earlier met with representatives from the US, China, and Japan. Suddenly, the old flame of friendship between Thailand and the Philippines was being rekindled.</p><p>It was supposed to be a 15-minute courtesy call but turned out to be a hefty discussion session lasting 35 minutes. The two talked about food security in the Philippines, ASEAN affairs, and the crisis in Myanmar, as well as prospects for Thailand and Philippine relations. They even found time for a little nostalgia, reminiscing about the visit of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej the Great and Queen Sirikit the Queen Mother to Manila in July 1963 even though the invitation came from the late president Diosdado Macapagal. Five years later, President Ferdinand Marcos made a three-day state visit to Bangkok in June 1968. King Bhumibol presented an honorary degree of law to the president. Now his son has told Mr Don that he will be attending the APEC 2022 leaders&#039; meeting in November in Bangkok.</p><p>The inaugural encounter was a good one as the new president, popularly known as Bongbong, said his country would import more rice from Thailand due to growing domestic demand. That&#039;s good news for Thai farmers and rice exporters. The Prayut government has to decide as soon as possible whether the rice deal will be done under the so-called government-to-government scheme or through solely private agreements. In the past, such deals were regulated by the government to guarantee the export price. That was when Thailand was the world&#039;s No.1 rice producer and exporter. Now, India and Vietnam are two major rice growers with competitive export prices. However, later on, Manila changed the procurement system and relied on the market mechanism. It is likely that the Thai government will respond positively to Bongbong&#039;s appeal.</p><p>During the meeting, the new president also touched on the negative impacts of the Russian-Ukraine war, which have affected countries around the world. The five-month war has already caused food crises. Due to time constraints, both sides agreed that there will be a new round of the Joint Commission on Bilateral Cooperation early next year after a gap of nine years.</p><p>Lest we forgot, the Philippines was the first country in Southeast Asia to sign a trade cooperation agreement with Thailand back in 1949. But bilateral trade volume was not impressive reaching only US$10.8 billion (385 billion baht) in 2020, where Thailand has enjoyed a trade surplus. Thai exports are mainly computer parts, electronic circuits and products, cosmetics, and edible oil.</p><p>It is hoped that upcoming rice exports will augment the trade volume. Dusit Thani Group, Charoen Pokphand, and Ital-Thai are big investors in the Philippines amounting to US$238 million, while Filipino investors such as San Miguel and Monte Nissan, putting in US$520 million, focus on beverages and consumer goods.</p><p>During the Cold War, Thailand and the Philippines were considered buddies in arms. They were strongly anti-communist and sided with the US as its allies. They were members under the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, popularly known as the Manila Pact. Albeit the military pact is now defunct, its offshoot, the Thanat-Rusk Communique of 1962, remains intact. From 1950-1953, their soldiers fought alongside each other in the Korean war as part of the international peacekeeping force. Thailand and the Philippines were the only two Southeast Asian countries to dispatch troops to the war. Both sides suffered a total of 1,368 casualties including 116 Filipino soldiers killed. Today, the two countries&#039; miniature flags can still be seen in the truce village of Panmunjom at the dividing line between North and South.</p><p>But truth be told, beyond that nobody has had anything to say about the Thailand-Philippines relations for ages, except on the Asean circuit. One simple reason is that the two countries have no mutual problems. To the Thais, the Filipinos are a reflection of themselves, friendly and easy-going, and fond of parties. They are day-to-day survivalists. To the Filipinos, Thais are like twin brothers raised by different partners who speak Thai. Lo and behold, among us, we cannot tell the difference until we open our mouths and speak.</p><div id="oa-360-1659511028670_jeudbkqei" data-dest="placeholder"><div id="oa-360-1659511028676_8fb8ohlyr"><div id="oa-360-1659511028676_nmhql7509"><div id="oa-360-1659511028676_a2oadati2"><div id="oa-360-1659511028676_4evatba1r" data-google-query-id="CKK5upSVqvkCFXrZcwEdSWAN0w">&nbsp;The golden years of Thai-Philippines relations ran from the 1950s to the 1980s, a time when the two countries were in the process of pump-priming economic development and progress amidst the mounting communist threat.

In the end, though, the wait was worthwhile because his latest visit further strengthened and deepened nearly two-century-old ties.
RECALIBRATION
The outcomes of both visits have demonstrated Thailand's abundant ability to recalibrate its diplomacy amid the disruptive world. Over the past three years, Thailand has gradually tightened loose ends in its foreign policy as domestic politics have been reasonably stable. Public concerns and support over health security and economic recovery during the Covid-19 pandemic have been a blessing in disguise for Thailand to reassess its foreign trajectory.
RE-ENGAGEMENT
The most noticeable development has been the re-engagement of the region's oldest friend and ally. The relations have rejuvenated their cooperation in new areas such as cyber security and space cooperation as well as new emerging threats. In addition, both countries also signed two important documents.
The first was the Thailand&ndash;US Communique on Strategic Alliance and Partnership, which reaffirms their alliance as well as common strategic goals. These include revitalising the post-Covid-19 economy, tackling climate change, cooperating on security and law enforcement, cybersecurity, space and technology collaboration, and promoting regional cooperation.
Equally important was the signing of the MoU on Promoting Supply Chain Resilience, which was delayed from December. This aims to promote collaboration to strengthen the supply chain and address disruptions to production, trade, and transportation, especially in critical industries.
Given the Thai government's priority of promoting US investment in new areas, this MoU will be extremely useful, particularly in new industries -- electric vehicles (EV) and high-capacity batteries, pharmaceuticals and industries that help promote the BCG Economy Model. However, Thailand's quick decision to be one of 14 founding signatories of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework was a significant move. But the one decision that earned applause from Washington was the unpublicised extradition to the US on June 16 of Dmitry Ukrainsky, a well-known hacker, who had been imprisoned in Thailand for the past ten years.

REINFORCEMENT
With Mr Wang's visit, Thailand and China relations have also been further reinforced in their cooperation and commitment. They are planning a grandiose event to mark the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic ties in 2025. The formation of a tripartite committee comprising representatives from Thailand, China and Laos on the high-speed train was a barometer for the Sino-Thai train project being on track and that it will be completed in 2028.

The 3Rs formula has enabled Thailand to court as well as sustain its dynamic ties with the US and China. Thai officials have admitted time and again that managing ties with these two superpowers is extremely difficult because of the interplay between the two countries' cultural, historical, political and economic linkages with Thailand.
The US often describes Thailand as its oldest and great friend while China refers to Sino-Thais as being the same family (zhong tai yi jia qin). Under the Biden administration, the US views China ties as a multi-layer relationship. It has an element of 'profound competition' at the heart of their relations. Then, there are also 'elements of cooperation' as well as 'elements of contestation'.
Just like many small countries trying to avoid direct or collateral damage from a US-China collision, Thailand's diplomatic statecraft, which saved the country from Western colonisation, still yields results with some tightening of nuts and bolts here and there.

The annual meeting has to confront sensitive new and divisive issues that will require the 55-year-old bloc&#039;s collective wisdom, commitment, and foresight.</p><p>At the upcoming annual meeting, external issues will dominate the agenda. The ripple effects of the Russian-Ukraine war, Myanmar&#039;s quagmire, and Timor Leste&#039; s membership of ASEAN are three hot issues that ASEAN members will spend time discussing. The earlier identified 36 priorities by the Cambodian chair during its first informal meeting in Siem Reap in January are still important for ASEAN. Indeed progress has been made on the cross-sectoral pillars but they have escaped public and media attention. However, for the benefit of Asean&#039;s optics in the international community, tackling these external issues forcefully is essential.</p><p>It will be interesting to watch the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine beyond the news headlines. On the diplomatic front, it is well-known that Asean members hold different views and positions on the war. Despite their divergent views, they managed to issue three joint statements to reiterate their common positions, which are still relevant today as the war is entering its sixth month. ASEAN is calling for an immediate ceasefire, peaceful negotiations, humanitarian assistance, and a full investigation into reported atrocities in Ukraine. ASEAN also stands ready to facilitate any peace efforts.</p><p>If the war drags on, greater repercussions will be felt on the bloc as a whole. The chair has already invited Russia and its leader to attend the AMM post-ministerial meeting and Asean-related summits despite the harsh criticism by Prime Minister Hun Sen of the invasion of Ukraine. Among the three former recipients of aid from the former Soviet Union with the others being Vietnam and the Lao People&#039;s Democratic Republic, Cambodia has been more liberal and in the process has become less dependent on Russia after the signing of the Paris Peace Agreement in 1991. Until recently, consortiums of donors had been assisting the country&#039;s socio-economic development. Phnom Penh&#039;s position on the conflict was pretty much closely aligned with the West. As the region&#039;s longest-reigning prime minister, Hun Sen is a leader for all terrains and seasons.</p><p>Again, it must be noted that Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand jointly issued in early May an unprecedented statement on the importance of international meetings they are currently hosting. They knew that the West would import the European conflict into the diplomatic arena in Southeast Asia. They also want Asean&#039;s support.</p><p>The joint statement succinctly reiterates that these meetings "share commonalities that provide a unique opportunity for all participating countries/economies to jointly advance the collective global and regional agenda and efforts to bring peace, prosperity, and sustainable and inclusive development to all our peoples". In short, please do not rock the boat, let us do our jobs -- promoting dialogue, cooperation and peace.</p><p>ASEAN leaders are hoping that their appeals will be welcome. Furthermore, they also hope that the war in Ukraine will come to an end before the festival of summits in the region so there is still time for dialogue and reconciliation. So far, that has not been the case. Both Indonesia and Thailand have already witnessed the diplomatic proxy war at the G20 foreign and economic ministerial meetings as well as the Apec 2022 trade ministerial meeting. There were walkouts and no joint statements due to Western countries&#039; boycott of Russia. If the war continues, all three summits will be held hostage by the two opposing groups in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p><p>Within the region, the Myanmar crisis has also reached a critical juncture. In the next five months, if Myanmar is unable to achieve so-called &#039;substantive progress&#039; under the five-point consensus (5PC), the chances for the State Administrative Council (SAC) to return to the Asian family&#039;s embrace do not look promising. Nay Pyi Taw will have another opportunity to respond positively the bloc as its special envoy will visit there in early September for the third time.</p><p>Kudos must go to Cambodia and its chairmanship for trying to create a conducive environment for all stakeholders to partake in the peace process under the 5PC. But real politics is fast and cruel. No parties concerned currently are willing to give in and jump-start the much-needed political dialogue. All sides are still fighting, causing high civilian casualties. They think erroneously that this war can be won.</p><p>The special envoy&#039;s latest trip was unable to produce the kind of breakthrough that warrants the presence of SAC Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin. So far, Prak Sokhonn, Asean&#039;s special envoy, has been trying to inform stakeholders and the public both inside and outside Myanmar of Asean&#039;s stance and ongoing efforts. He has given detailed information about his past two visits to Myanmar so the international community can judge the values and role of the special envoy, especially those that are work in progress.</p><p>Indeed, the status of the ASEAN special envoy remains a tricky topic, which will be discussed at the August ministerial meeting. ASEAN ministers understand well the rotational appointment does not have sufficient time to manage and follow up on all issues that have been raised to resolve Myanmar&#039;s crisis. It is possible that ASEAN might consider a new formula that would elect a special envoy permanently attaching to the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta. The new envoy will continue, regardless of the chair, with the mandate to follow up on progress in Myanmar.</p><p>As the next ASEAN chair, Indonesia will be influential in determing the status of the ASEAN special envoy. Jakarta has strongly supported its veteran diplomat, Hassan Wirajuda, to man the post. Malaysia, which earlier proposed the idea of a permanent special envoy, has its own favourite candidate, former Myanmar special envoy, Tan Sri Ismail Razali.</p><p>Another bone of contention will be Timor Leste&#039;s membership of ASEAN. Over the past decade, right after Dili stated that this tiny country wanted to join Asean in 2002, the pros and cons of having the world&#039;s youngest democracy and poorest nation have been widely discussed. ASEAN leaders, knowing full well the long-term ramifications of having an 11th member, have not been very enthusiastic. So they seldom talk about it.</p><p>Today, the fate of Timor Leste&#039;s Asean membership remains uncertain. Most of the opposition is targeted at the country&#039;s economic backwardness, poverty, and inability and low-level of readiness to take part in hundreds of ASEAN meetings annually. Indeed, the same was true in the case of CLM (Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar) but their integration with the ASEAN community had been proceeding uninterrupted. However, the Feb 1 coup in Myanmar dented the grouping&#039;s seamless integration.</p><p>Other issues impacting Timor Leste&#039;s membership have been the country&#039;s liberal-minded system and diplomatic legacy and direction. Certain ASEAN members fear the new member would invite additional uncertainty, albeit increasing democratic credibility, and partisanship, further complicating the bloc&#039;s decision-making process. Furthermore, for better or worse, it will bring into focus the sharp contrast in both image and discourse with other small Asean members.</p><p>Truth be told, like the other new members joined Asean after 1995, peer assistance and empathy will help Timor Leste, if admitted, to quickly become acquainted with the ASEAN way and other manners. During his recent visit to Jakarta, President Ramos-Horta stated his case to Indonesian President Joko Widodo that his country hoped to join Asean during his chairmanship next year and it to be highly symbolic. Recently, a fact-finding team from the Asean Economic Community was in Dili to assess the situation. With all reports in from representatives from the three communities, the decision now can be made. No more excuses.</p><p>Judging from the earlier draft of the 55th ASEAN joint communique, most of the attention will zero in on the Russia-Ukraine war and Myanmar, which will be negotiated until the final minutes. Other regional issues such as the situation in the South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula will have more or less similar content to the previous year.</p><p>In the case of the South China Sea, Asean will emphasise the need to pursue the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law. In addition, ASEAN expects the second reading of the first draft to be completed by the end of this year under the Cambodian chair. If that is the case, then the code of conduct could be finalised under the Indonesian chair next year.</p><p>Throughout its history, ASEAN will continue to adjust and improve its organisation in an incremental way. To prepare for the future, the High Level Task Force will soon submit the so-called central elements they want to see included in the ASEAN Vision beyond 2025. There will be some exciting and unexpected elements for the new ASEAN vision. Some countries have already lamented that a ten-year vision (2025-2035) is too short and that ASEAN should have a 20-year vision from 2025-2045 to be ready for the metaverse world.</p><p><em>This opinion piece was written by ERIA&#039;s Senior Communications Advisor, Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, and has been published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2354207/upcoming-amm-facing-uphill-tasks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bangkok Post.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:0:"";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:20003:"Upcoming AMM Facing Uphill Tasks Upcoming AMM Facing Uphill Tasks By Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, Senior Communications Advisor:&nbsp; The ASEAN Foreign Ministerial Meeting (AMM) next week will be a test of its centrality and relevancy as never seen before.

Therefore, the recent diplomatic flurry of high-profile visits by Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, shows the country&#039;s efforts to stay ahead of today&#039;s rapidly changing strategic landscape, in particular in the Indo-Pacific region.</p><p>As the world&#039;s third-largest democracy, Jakarta has the legitimacy to be more outgoing and speak for the wider world from Southeast Asian perspectives. That helps explain why these days Indonesia also attracts attention from all the great powers, especially during its current chair of G20. In addition, in his second term, Jokowi could not resist making his presence felt outside his own country. As the only ASEAN member of the G20, Jakarta views itself as a regional juggernaut. Other Muslim countries such as Turkiye, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have also become proactive and are playing the big diplomatic games. Now be aware: Indonesia is rising with better democratic credentials.</p><p>Jakarta&#039;s role in regional and international peace and security is paramount. In the age of the Indo-Pacific, with its vast archipelagic spread, maritime security and safety will become even more important amid the heightening US-China rivalry and growing economic and strategic importance of sea-lane communications. Its non-aligned diplomacy and Pancasila (five principles of peaceful coexistence) since independence are going through a recalibration. Lest we forget, Jakarta was one of the main driving forces of the Asean Outlook for the Indo-Pacific.</p><p>Although Jokowi&#039;s peace mission to Ukraine and Russia to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Vladimir Putin did not bring any breakthroughs in lessening the tensions, it did raise concerns about the negative impacts the conflict has had on the world, highlighting the food and energy crisis as the disastrous result of the war as well as boost the current chair of the G20.</p><p>In fact, more important trips were his just-completed five-day shuttle diplomacy through East Asia. The trips were extremely significant and each stop was choreographed to a tee. Due to the current state of relations among the ASEAN plus three (APT) countries (China, Japan, and South Korea), Indonesia must walk a tightrope and cannot afford to offend any one of these nations. All of them are crucial to Indonesia&#039;s foreign investment, economic development, and future prosperity as well as a security guarantee.</p><p>Jokowi&#039;s trips have three important purposes. The first is an obvious one -- making sure leaders participate in the G20 and ensuring its success. At the G20 foreign and finance ministerial meetings, the members were divisively plagued by walkouts, no statements, and other shenanigans. Indonesia is hoping that during the G20 summit all the leaders will show up and become less hostile.</p><p>The second is to forge closer ties with each of Asean&#039;s three Asian powerhouses.

After all, China has been its No.1 trading partner for the past nine years and in the future, their trade volume will further increase.

Dr Songwe highlighted the importance of a facility focused on liquidity and sustainability that can help Africa to improve&nbsp; market access as well as the importance to strengthen energy transition in the future. Professor Obstfeld recommended that the G20 improve cooperation and create a common framework, particularly for debt treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).

Professor Lin underlined the need for governments to improve regulations in relation to green ideas and actions as well as the need for multilateral international organizations to provide funding, particularly to developing countries, to overcome green transition challenges. Professor Diwan highlighted two tracks to scale up green finance: (1) short term push through the $100 billion pledge and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs); and (2) long-term reforms through enhancing the role of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and expanding carbon markets.

Dr Darren Chua, inspirational speaker and empowerment coach of the Mindset Transformation Clinic Singapore, brought up the importance of using certain terms&nbsp; such as &lsquo;people with different abilities&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;persons with disabilities&rsquo;.&nbsp; Dr Roger Chao Jr., Assistant Director and Head of the Education, Youth and Sports Division of the ASEAN Secretariat, spoke on the importance of integrated policies and policy advocacy to &nbsp;better understand inclusive education. He called for better provision of financial and human resources and capacity in the implementation of policies at the grassroots level.
The webinar&rsquo;s panel discussion was moderated by TJ Ooi, Lead Consultant of ERIA&rsquo;s Entrepreneurship, Start-ups, and Innovation Knowledge Lab, whilst the question-and-answer session was moderated by Lina Maulidina Sabrina, ERIA&rsquo;s Programme Officer, who discussed the key actions that need to be done amongst stakeholders to promote inclusive education in ASEAN.             2022-07-21 21 July 2022 2202 yluJ 12 12-70-2202             .NAESA ni noitacude evisulcni etomorp ot sredlohekats tsgnoma enod eb ot deen taht snoitca yek eht dessucsid ohw ,reciffO emmargorP s;ouqsr&AIRE ,anirbaS anidiluaM aniL yb detaredom saw noisses rewsna-dna-noitseuq eht tslihw ,baL egdelwonK noitavonnI dna ,spu-tratS ,pihsruenerpertnE s;ouqsr&AIRE fo tnatlusnoC daeL ,ioO JT yb detaredom saw noissucsid lenap s;ouqsr&ranibew ehT

Nevertheless, rates of self-employment and firm creation show that gender gaps still exist in numerous sectors, including entrepreneurship. Addressing disparities between men and women entrepreneurs could enhance innovation, create jobs, raise productivity, increase competitiveness, and increase wealth.</p><p>Gender gaps in entrepreneurship, raising awareness of them, and finding possible solutions to close them were the focus of a webinar hosted by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) and the Tokyo Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on 5 July 2022. The webinar aimed to bring together expertise and knowledge regarding the region, data, policy, education, and gender issues, and to identify ways to address potential structural and emerging challenges that may be impeding women entrepreneurship. The webinar followed the launch of ERIA&rsquo;s Entrepreneurship, Start-ups, and Innovation (E-S-I) Knowledge Lab as part of the institute&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to engage the growing community of innovators, aspiring entrepreneurs, and start-up founders in the region.</p><p>In his opening remarks, Mr Toru Furuichi, ERIA&rsquo;s Director General for Research and Policy Design Administration, expressed gratitude to the webinar&rsquo;s participants and panellists, &nbsp;and to OECD, which co-organised the event. He noted the importance of the webinar in boosting the momentum of women&rsquo;s entrepreneurship in Asia from various perspectives, including policy gaps, inclusiveness, and data correction to further promote and raise awareness of the issue.</p><p>In the panel discussion, Ms Naoko Kawaguchi, Acting Head of the OECD&rsquo;s Tokyo Centre, gave a brief progress report on the adherence of its member countries to OECD&rsquo;s recommendations.

Nevertheless, rates of self-employment and firm creation show that gender gaps still exist in numerous sectors, including entrepreneurship. Addressing disparities between men and women entrepreneurs could enhance innovation, create jobs, raise productivity, increase competitiveness, and increase wealth.
Gender gaps in entrepreneurship, raising awareness of them, and finding possible solutions to close them were the focus of a webinar hosted by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) and the Tokyo Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on 5 July 2022. The webinar aimed to bring together expertise and knowledge regarding the region, data, policy, education, and gender issues, and to identify ways to address potential structural and emerging challenges that may be impeding women entrepreneurship. The webinar followed the launch of ERIA&rsquo;s Entrepreneurship, Start-ups, and Innovation (E-S-I) Knowledge Lab as part of the institute&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to engage the growing community of innovators, aspiring entrepreneurs, and start-up founders in the region.
In his opening remarks, Mr Toru Furuichi, ERIA&rsquo;s Director General for Research and Policy Design Administration, expressed gratitude to the webinar&rsquo;s participants and panellists, &nbsp;and to OECD, which co-organised the event. He noted the importance of the webinar in boosting the momentum of women&rsquo;s entrepreneurship in Asia from various perspectives, including policy gaps, inclusiveness, and data correction to further promote and raise awareness of the issue.
In the panel discussion, Ms Naoko Kawaguchi, Acting Head of the OECD&rsquo;s Tokyo Centre, gave a brief progress report on the adherence of its member countries to OECD&rsquo;s recommendations. She said empowering women and tapping untapped sources can result in more sustainable and inclusive economic growth. She shared that across the OECD countries, gender gaps in entrepreneurship have slightly narrowed, although women experience greater barriers than men in setting up and maintaining businesses. Nevertheless, she said, addressing gender equality and promoting diversity are pivotal in pushing economic growth.
Ms Kanyasorn Tansubhapol, Assistant to the President for Special Affairs of Chulalongkorn University, narrated how the university president had proposed to the university council setting up an innovation hub to encourage lecturers and researchers to&nbsp;demonstrate their research into practical application. She said women mentorship is important, citing cases of alumni who encouraged women to take part in research.
Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, ERIA&rsquo;s Director for Strategy and Partnership, said it is important to promote more women to tap into the digital economy amidst the robust digital transformation, especially in the post-pandemic period.

He added that in empowering the poor, one must first&nbsp; understand the root cause of such condition where people are powerless in terms of access to finance, skills, social support, healthcare, and clean energy.
In his closing remarks, Mr Hachiyama, after positively evaluating the enriching discussions amongst practitioners and experts at the workshop, said that projects to help the poor need to incorporate local knowledge and experience to ensure that they are sustainable and reflective of the needs of local community. He added that the ideas and views shared at the workshop had brought in new perspectives from various stakeholders that will be useful in the formulation of the ASEAN Master Plan on Rural Development and Poverty Eradication, which will be submitted to the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Rural Development and Poverty Eradication in 2022.             2022-07-07 7 July 2022 2202 yluJ 7 70-70-2202             .2202 ni noitacidarE ytrevoP dna tnempoleveD laruR no gniteeM lairetsiniM NAESA eht ot dettimbus eb lliw hcihw ,noitacidarE ytrevoP dna tnempoleveD laruR no nalP retsaM NAESA eht fo noitalumrof eht ni lufesu eb lliw taht sredlohekats suoirav morf sevitcepsrep wen ni thguorb dah pohskrow eht ta derahs sweiv dna saedi eht taht dedda eH .ytinummoc lacol fo sdeen eht fo evitcelfer dna elbaniatsus era yeht taht erusne ot ecneirepxe dna egdelwonk lacol etaroprocni ot deen roop eht pleh ot stcejorp taht dias ,pohskrow eht ta strepxe dna srenoititcarp tsgnoma snoissucsid gnihcirne eht gnitaulave ylevitisop retfa ,amayihcaH rM ,skramer gnisolc sih nI

The conference was held at the Main Conference Hall, International Convention Centre, Bandar Seri Begawan, and was attended by Yang Berhormat Dato Seri Paduka Dr Haji Abdul Manaf bin Haji Metussin, Minister of Primary Resources and Tourism, Brunei Darussalam, as well as government officials, intergovernmental organizations, academics, and experts from Brunei Darussalam and across the region.</p><p>Following welcome remarks by Yang Mulia Professor Dr Dayang Hajah Zohrah binti Haji Sulaiman, Vice-Chancellor, Universiti Teknologi Brunei, and opening remarks by the Minister of Primary Resources, Professor Nishimura gave the keynote speech which focused on Digital Pathways for improving productivity, profitability, and sustainability of agrifood systems.</p><p>He started his presentation by sharing the current challenging conditions of the agricultural sector such as increasing food demand due to population growth, and soaring food prices caused by several factors including the war in the Ukraine.

The conference was held at the Main Conference Hall, International Convention Centre, Bandar Seri Begawan, and was attended by Yang Berhormat Dato Seri Paduka Dr Haji Abdul Manaf bin Haji Metussin, Minister of Primary Resources and Tourism, Brunei Darussalam, as well as government officials, intergovernmental organizations, academics, and experts from Brunei Darussalam and across the region.
Following welcome remarks by Yang Mulia Professor Dr Dayang Hajah Zohrah binti Haji Sulaiman, Vice-Chancellor, Universiti Teknologi Brunei, and opening remarks by the Minister of Primary Resources, Professor Nishimura gave the keynote speech which focused on Digital Pathways for improving productivity, profitability, and sustainability of agrifood systems.
He started his presentation by sharing the current challenging conditions of the agricultural sector such as increasing food demand due to population growth, and soaring food prices caused by several factors including the war in the Ukraine. The agriculture sector in ASEAN still plays an important role in terms of contribution to GDP and as a source of national employment. The digital transformation of agriculture brings new opportunities such as the creation of new markets through digital platforms and leads to a greater contribution to national economies.
Also, he introduced findings from the study on digital agriculture conducted by ERIA. As examples of recommended action, he suggested creating a common digital platform that connects all partners&rsquo; data on farming and other agriculture-related activities and enhancing the application of FinTech solutions to realise the agricultural digital marketplace.
Further, Prof Nishimura suggested policy options for realising the inclusive digitalisation of agriculture: &nbsp;(i) Develop an action plan that would build digital and entrepreneurial skills, and empower small-scale farmers, youth, and women, (ii) Build the capacity of agriculture ministries for a decentralised, consensus-based record-keeping system and data sharing mechanism amongst farmers, agribusinesses, and policymakers, (iii) Adopt a nexus approach to prioritise cross-sectoral policy themes and the distribution of public investments, (iv) Formulate a regional governance structure to support digitally enabled sustainable agriculture solutions.
The conference continued with presentations by other speakers including the representative from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan on 'Digital Agriculture Eco Nursery Project&rsquo;, and several sessions of panel discussions focusing on agricultural technologies.             2022-07-02 2 July 2022 2202 yluJ 2 20-70-2202             .seigolonhcet larutlucirga no gnisucof snoissucsid lenap fo snoisses lareves dna ,;ouqsr&tcejorP yresruN ocE erutlucirgA latigiD' no napaJ fo yrtsudnI dna edarT ,ymonocE fo yrtsiniM eht morf evitatneserper eht gnidulcni srekaeps rehto yb snoitatneserp htiw deunitnoc ecnerefnoc ehT

Phnom Penh realized that as the last member to join the grouping, it can also serve as a catalyst for other newcomers to further integrate with the ASEAN Community. After more than two decades, the country can boast that it has largely integrated with the regional economy.

Phnom Penh realized that as the last member to join the grouping, it can also serve as a catalyst for other newcomers to further integrate with the ASEAN Community. After more than two decades, the country can boast that it has largely integrated with the regional economy. For instance, the country is now one of the most open financial hubs in ASEAN.

It long and continued civilisational linkages in the Indo-Pacific are there for all to see. One of the most frequently asked questions today is: Will India lead the Indo-Pacific region? Or, one can turn the question around: Can India lead or does the world&#039;s largest democracy have to trail behind the West? It depends on the levels and persons you talk to.</p><p>At the 12th Asean-India Dialogue in New Delhi last week, both Indian and international participants expressed ambivalence as to whether New Delhi can live up to the new perceived role as a global leader to provide the much-needed diplomatic trajectory for those countries which share a similar outlook to that of India.</p><p>However, more robust views are coming from the 17-point joint-statement on the Special Asean-India foreign ministers&#039; meeting, who were here to commemorate its 30th anniversary over the weekend. In all their statements, they were very enthusiastic that India would be featured strongly in Indo-Pacific. Both ASEAN and India must work together, converge their action plans and priorities so that they can prevent outside powers from gain any hegemonic posture in the region.</p><p>Indian External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar, was succinct in praising Asean as the bloc that has successfully carved out a niche for itself in the region and provided the foundation for evolving strategic and economic architecture in the Indo-Pacific. &#039;India, Asean ties must respond to the world that we confront,&#039; he reiterated that ASEAN &#039;has always stood tall as a beacon on regionalism, multilateralism and globalisation&#039;.</p><p>At this juncture, the conflict in Ukraine is impacting harshly on the global economy and disrupting its supply chains. India&#039;s economic development is no exception. For one thing, India continues to rely on cheap energy sources from Russia. Without energy security and a healthy economy, India&#039;s perceived role at the international level, real or imagined, would be unattainable.</p><p>For the time being, India has to deal with domestic problems which have dented its international reputation. The recent row with some Middle Eastern countries over comments related to the Prophet by an Indian politician, who has since been suspended, has caused widespread allegations of Islamophobia in the world&#039;s largest democracy. Over the weekend, the protests at the contentious Agnipath scheme for military recruitment have spread across states and further agitated the youth, who are looking for jobs and a better future.</p><p>Looking eastward, India generates greater hope and expectations. For obvious reasons, India&#039;s relations with ASEAN, for all the promises and potential, have yet to be be fulfilled as both sides still have some issues to settle. The 30th anniversary of ASEAN-India relations, while they were widely celebrated, serves as a reminder that the longstanding relations will remain benign if there are no efforts to re-energise them because of pressing domestic challenges.</p><p>Last week, the ASEAN-Indian special foreign ministerial meeting decided that New Delhi needs to demonstrate that an elevated status from strategic partner to comprehensive strategic partner would bring more benefits to ASEAN and their relations. ASEAN could not reach a consensus on India&#039;s new status. Over the past years, India has sought to review the Asia-India Free Agreement on Trade in Goods, which was signed in 2000. The agreement slashed duties by 64% cross the board.</p><p>Fortunately, at present, New Delhi is maximising its bravado that it can withstand continued pressure from the US and Europe. Without openly concurring, all the ASEAN members rallied behind India for its independent stand. Indeed, India&#039;s position is not bruising US-India ties in any way despite the negative comments coming from Washington and its allies.</p><p>Certainly, as a member of Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, India&#039;s calculus on the Russia-Ukraine quagmire could eventually fade. At this juncture, given the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic threat, India is concentrating on the domestic front to bring down inflation, decentralise federal power and ensure society&#039;s openness where all religious beliefs and creeds can coexist.</p><p>There was some strong sentiment inside Asean that India should be granted the CSP as soon as possible while others thought India had to do more to open up its market. India&#039;s last-minute pull-out from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership still clouds feelings about India&#039;s real intentions.</p><p>ASEAN hopes that by the time their leaders meet in Phnom Penh in early November, India will be able to come up with a new list of incentives to convince reluctant members to respond favourably. Truth be told, ASEAN would like to grant both the US and India the CSP at the same time at the Asean-related summits.</p><p>Some Indian scholars, in private discussions, were frank saying that relations with ASEAN are extremely useful for improving India&#039;s regional power, both in security and economic terms. The combined population of India and ASEAN is over 2 billion, spreading from the West to Africa and beyond and from the East to East Asia and Oceania. Their joint GDP could reach US$7 trillion, the fourth largest in the world, in the not-so-distant future.</p><p>At the special Asean-India foreign ministerial meeting, all leaders agreed unanimously that India and ASEAN must further consolidate their relations. After all, throughout the past three decades, their ties have expanded and deepened. But amidst the prevailing enthusiasm, there is an equally strong sense of disappointment. In understanding what has been missing in ASEAN-India relations, ongoing Asean-China ties have often been used as a barometer in measuring their effectiveness and approaches and implementation.</p><p>The differences are clear. Both signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in 2003 allowing them to proceed with strengthening cooperation with ASEAN. Since then, China has proceeded with strengthening and deepening relentlessly, making Asean-China ties one of the most dynamic of all dialogue partners.</p><p>India knows well that it can never compete with China in Southeast Asia, but New Delhi hopes that its values and democracy would win hearts and minds in the region. Furthermore, in the age of the Indo-Pacific, both ASEAN and India hope that their frameworks could converge and further strengthen their cooperation.</p><p>That helps explain why India is promoting people-to-people connectivity. The Southeast Asian economy has suffered over the last two-plus years of the Covid-19 pandemic due to its over dependence on Chinese tourists. In certain countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, and the Philippines, forecast economic growth has been held back.</p><p>In recent weeks, with China still clamping down on tourism, Indian tourists have become the new revenue generators for cash-starved Southeast Asia. India&#039;s budget airlines are going places throughout the region where tourist attractions are high and to which special visas have been granted.</p><p>One positive thing about India is that it has never imposed any value and norms on smaller countries, especially in its engagement with ASEAN over the past three decades.

India and ASEAN at 30: What's up? By Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, Senior Communications Advisor:&nbsp;&nbsp;On its own, India stands tall and fearless. It long and continued civilisational linkages in the Indo-Pacific are there for all to see. One of the most frequently asked questions today is: Will India lead the Indo-Pacific region? Or, one can turn the question around: Can India lead or does the world's largest democracy have to trail behind the West? It depends on the levels and persons you talk to.
At the 12th Asean-India Dialogue in New Delhi last week, both Indian and international participants expressed ambivalence as to whether New Delhi can live up to the new perceived role as a global leader to provide the much-needed diplomatic trajectory for those countries which share a similar outlook to that of India.
However, more robust views are coming from the 17-point joint-statement on the Special Asean-India foreign ministers' meeting, who were here to commemorate its 30th anniversary over the weekend. In all their statements, they were very enthusiastic that India would be featured strongly in Indo-Pacific. Both ASEAN and India must work together, converge their action plans and priorities so that they can prevent outside powers from gain any hegemonic posture in the region.
Indian External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar, was succinct in praising Asean as the bloc that has successfully carved out a niche for itself in the region and provided the foundation for evolving strategic and economic architecture in the Indo-Pacific. 'India, Asean ties must respond to the world that we confront,' he reiterated that ASEAN 'has always stood tall as a beacon on regionalism, multilateralism and globalisation'.
At this juncture, the conflict in Ukraine is impacting harshly on the global economy and disrupting its supply chains. India's economic development is no exception. For one thing, India continues to rely on cheap energy sources from Russia. Without energy security and a healthy economy, India's perceived role at the international level, real or imagined, would be unattainable.
For the time being, India has to deal with domestic problems which have dented its international reputation. The recent row with some Middle Eastern countries over comments related to the Prophet by an Indian politician, who has since been suspended, has caused widespread allegations of Islamophobia in the world's largest democracy. Over the weekend, the protests at the contentious Agnipath scheme for military recruitment have spread across states and further agitated the youth, who are looking for jobs and a better future.
Looking eastward, India generates greater hope and expectations. For obvious reasons, India's relations with ASEAN, for all the promises and potential, have yet to be be fulfilled as both sides still have some issues to settle. The 30th anniversary of ASEAN-India relations, while they were widely celebrated, serves as a reminder that the longstanding relations will remain benign if there are no efforts to re-energise them because of pressing domestic challenges.
Last week, the ASEAN-Indian special foreign ministerial meeting decided that New Delhi needs to demonstrate that an elevated status from strategic partner to comprehensive strategic partner would bring more benefits to ASEAN and their relations. ASEAN could not reach a consensus on India's new status. Over the past years, India has sought to review the Asia-India Free Agreement on Trade in Goods, which was signed in 2000. The agreement slashed duties by 64% cross the board.
Fortunately, at present, New Delhi is maximising its bravado that it can withstand continued pressure from the US and Europe. Without openly concurring, all the ASEAN members rallied behind India for its independent stand. Indeed, India's position is not bruising US-India ties in any way despite the negative comments coming from Washington and its allies.
Certainly, as a member of Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, India's calculus on the Russia-Ukraine quagmire could eventually fade. At this juncture, given the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic threat, India is concentrating on the domestic front to bring down inflation, decentralise federal power and ensure society's openness where all religious beliefs and creeds can coexist.
There was some strong sentiment inside Asean that India should be granted the CSP as soon as possible while others thought India had to do more to open up its market. India's last-minute pull-out from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership still clouds feelings about India's real intentions.
ASEAN hopes that by the time their leaders meet in Phnom Penh in early November, India will be able to come up with a new list of incentives to convince reluctant members to respond favourably. Truth be told, ASEAN would like to grant both the US and India the CSP at the same time at the Asean-related summits.
Some Indian scholars, in private discussions, were frank saying that relations with ASEAN are extremely useful for improving India's regional power, both in security and economic terms. The combined population of India and ASEAN is over 2 billion, spreading from the West to Africa and beyond and from the East to East Asia and Oceania. Their joint GDP could reach US$7 trillion, the fourth largest in the world, in the not-so-distant future.
At the special Asean-India foreign ministerial meeting, all leaders agreed unanimously that India and ASEAN must further consolidate their relations. After all, throughout the past three decades, their ties have expanded and deepened. But amidst the prevailing enthusiasm, there is an equally strong sense of disappointment. In understanding what has been missing in ASEAN-India relations, ongoing Asean-China ties have often been used as a barometer in measuring their effectiveness and approaches and implementation.
The differences are clear. Both signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in 2003 allowing them to proceed with strengthening cooperation with ASEAN. Since then, China has proceeded with strengthening and deepening relentlessly, making Asean-China ties one of the most dynamic of all dialogue partners.
India knows well that it can never compete with China in Southeast Asia, but New Delhi hopes that its values and democracy would win hearts and minds in the region. Furthermore, in the age of the Indo-Pacific, both ASEAN and India hope that their frameworks could converge and further strengthen their cooperation.
That helps explain why India is promoting people-to-people connectivity. The Southeast Asian economy has suffered over the last two-plus years of the Covid-19 pandemic due to its over dependence on Chinese tourists. In certain countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, and the Philippines, forecast economic growth has been held back.
In recent weeks, with China still clamping down on tourism, Indian tourists have become the new revenue generators for cash-starved Southeast Asia. India's budget airlines are going places throughout the region where tourist attractions are high and to which special visas have been granted.
One positive thing about India is that it has never imposed any value and norms on smaller countries, especially in its engagement with ASEAN over the past three decades. That helps explain why the bloc feels at ease dealing with India. As such, there has been no sense of urgency as India does not pose any threat to the region. But the disruptive developments elsewhere, in particular war in Europe, have already changed the whole status quo of power relations in the post-World War II international system. Both ASEAN and India want to make sure now that this big chunk of Asians in this neighborhood want to see the maintenance of peace and prosperity.

All of these countries are on the same page as far as ASEAN is concerned. An ASEAN that is stable, peaceful, and focused on regional economic integration would be beneficial to the international community. This trend is in reverse in other parts of the world.</p><p>The US-China rivalry has divided Europe, South America, and the Pacific islands, while Asean still holds on to its founding fathers&#039; principle of not siding with any power, big or small. For the past five decades, the bloc has continued to reject the oft-mentioned plan to form a collective military coalition. Instead, ASEAN has chosen to play the role of peacemaker. Quite often, the grouping has been severely criticised for its discreet and non-military actions.</p><p>Obviously, the Russia-Ukraine war is an extremely difficult situation for ASEAN members to navigate. Despite their different views and adopted measures, ASEAN has so far managed to collectively agree on a common position as stated succinctly in its statements on March 3 and April 8, calling for a ceasefire, peace talks and humanitarian assistance.</p><p>As the war continues, there are still opportunities to make peace outside Europe. Since the war began on Feb 24, all concerned parties have been talking about the possibility of a diplomatic solution. Today, the window that was wide open during the first 100 days is closing. In the coming weeks and months, conflicting parties have to think outside the box about the possibility of utilising multilateral forums, which will be held in three ASEAN countries in the next few months.</p><p>When Bangkok hosted the ministerial meeting for trade last month, the six democracies boycotted the planned joint statement and issued their own. The statement was a symbolic move necessitated by the war zone. Thailand was on the receiving end. Bangkok chose to play down the discord, instead of focusing on what the Asia-Pacific economies agreed on regarding trade and investment in the post-Covid-19 scenario.</p><p>For the sake of US-China relations, at the multinational security forum, the Shangri-La Dialogue, in Singapore last week, the first face-to-face meeting between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese National Defence Minister Gen Wei Fenghe took place. Despite much-anticipated exchanges of tough rhetoric, there was one positive outcome -- both sides need more dialogue in the near future. At this juncture, whatever their leaders said, they had in mind the domestic audience. So, they put on a brave face while the Russia-Ukraine conflict is still raging.</p><p>Doubtless, China continues to reiterate its well-known position that Beijing would respond resolutely with countermeasures of its own if anyone wants to make use of the Ukraine war to undermine China&#039;s interests, especially regarding the future of Taiwan. On the US side, Gen Austin made a strong point of Washington&#039;s opposition to any unilateral changes to the status quo over the Taiwan Strait. Washington also reiterated its respect for the one-China policy.</p><p>US and Chinese leaders will have ample opportunity to fine-tune their relations amid a friendly environment in ASEAN. At the upcoming 29th Asean Regional Forum (ARF) on Aug 5 to be held in Phnom Penh, the two countries will join the other 25 Asia-Pacific members to discuss confidence-building measures and preventive diplomacy, the two elements that are urgently needed.</p><p>Lest we forget, it has been at the ARF forum that the US and China learned more about each other&#039;s divergent and common views that have led to better understanding. Most importantly, they have learned to coexist and cooperate. At the time, the West, in particular the US, wanted to engage China as it was rising gradually. Next year, the ARF will commemorate its 30th anniversary, with Indonesia as the host, and more intensified engagements are expected among them and other members. Many activities are planned to reduce tensions and increase mutual trust and confidence.</p><p>At the ARF senior officials meeting on June 9 via video conference, to prepare for the future challenges, all members agreed to boost the funding of the ARF activities with ASEAN as the core. Each ASEAN member and dialogue partner is encouraged to chip in. At the moment, ASEAN is working on the terms of reference for the ARF Fund.</p><p>Under the current circumstances, the 27-ARF members also agreed that they need to strengthen cooperation, enhance dialogue, instil trust, and promote confidence-building measures to face common security challenges. All members also agreed that the threats to security in cyberspace should be the main focus, not to mention the rise of violent extremism and terrorism.</p><p>In a related development, Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen reiterated that US-China relations are too complex to be resolved in one meeting. Certainly, after their first encounter, both sides will need more dialogue, for which ASEAN has a safe space for both of them to talk and cajole, ie, the East Asia Summit in Phnom Penh, the G20 summit in Bali and the 2022 Asia Pacific leaders&#039; meeting in Bangkok. All three summits will be held between Nov 10-19. If they so desire, they can hold many bilateral meetings in this period.</p><p>Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida praised the role of ASEAN in his keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue for upholding unity and centrality to ensure growth while maintaining diversity and inclusiveness. If the world&#039;s third economic power has such strong trust in ASEAN, it is about time that Asean expanded its role to reduce US-China tensions and improve their relations.</p><p><em>This opinion piece was written by ERIA&#039;s Senior Communications Advisor, Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, and has been published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2325623/asean-where-us-china-can-reconcile-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bangkok Post.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:44:"/uploads/news/20220614/istock-1087673356.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:12753:"ASEAN: Where US, China can Reconcile?

For the past five decades, the bloc has continued to reject the oft-mentioned plan to form a collective military coalition. Instead, ASEAN has chosen to play the role of peacemaker. Quite often, the grouping has been severely criticised for its discreet and non-military actions.
Obviously, the Russia-Ukraine war is an extremely difficult situation for ASEAN members to navigate. Despite their different views and adopted measures, ASEAN has so far managed to collectively agree on a common position as stated succinctly in its statements on March 3 and April 8, calling for a ceasefire, peace talks and humanitarian assistance.
As the war continues, there are still opportunities to make peace outside Europe. Since the war began on Feb 24, all concerned parties have been talking about the possibility of a diplomatic solution. Today, the window that was wide open during the first 100 days is closing. In the coming weeks and months, conflicting parties have to think outside the box about the possibility of utilising multilateral forums, which will be held in three ASEAN countries in the next few months.
When Bangkok hosted the ministerial meeting for trade last month, the six democracies boycotted the planned joint statement and issued their own. The statement was a symbolic move necessitated by the war zone. Thailand was on the receiving end. Bangkok chose to play down the discord, instead of focusing on what the Asia-Pacific economies agreed on regarding trade and investment in the post-Covid-19 scenario.
For the sake of US-China relations, at the multinational security forum, the Shangri-La Dialogue, in Singapore last week, the first face-to-face meeting between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese National Defence Minister Gen Wei Fenghe took place. Despite much-anticipated exchanges of tough rhetoric, there was one positive outcome -- both sides need more dialogue in the near future. At this juncture, whatever their leaders said, they had in mind the domestic audience. So, they put on a brave face while the Russia-Ukraine conflict is still raging.
Doubtless, China continues to reiterate its well-known position that Beijing would respond resolutely with countermeasures of its own if anyone wants to make use of the Ukraine war to undermine China's interests, especially regarding the future of Taiwan. On the US side, Gen Austin made a strong point of Washington's opposition to any unilateral changes to the status quo over the Taiwan Strait. Washington also reiterated its respect for the one-China policy.
US and Chinese leaders will have ample opportunity to fine-tune their relations amid a friendly environment in ASEAN. At the upcoming 29th Asean Regional Forum (ARF) on Aug 5 to be held in Phnom Penh, the two countries will join the other 25 Asia-Pacific members to discuss confidence-building measures and preventive diplomacy, the two elements that are urgently needed.
Lest we forget, it has been at the ARF forum that the US and China learned more about each other's divergent and common views that have led to better understanding. Most importantly, they have learned to coexist and cooperate. At the time, the West, in particular the US, wanted to engage China as it was rising gradually. Next year, the ARF will commemorate its 30th anniversary, with Indonesia as the host, and more intensified engagements are expected among them and other members. Many activities are planned to reduce tensions and increase mutual trust and confidence.
At the ARF senior officials meeting on June 9 via video conference, to prepare for the future challenges, all members agreed to boost the funding of the ARF activities with ASEAN as the core. Each ASEAN member and dialogue partner is encouraged to chip in. At the moment, ASEAN is working on the terms of reference for the ARF Fund.
Under the current circumstances, the 27-ARF members also agreed that they need to strengthen cooperation, enhance dialogue, instil trust, and promote confidence-building measures to face common security challenges. All members also agreed that the threats to security in cyberspace should be the main focus, not to mention the rise of violent extremism and terrorism.
In a related development, Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen reiterated that US-China relations are too complex to be resolved in one meeting. Certainly, after their first encounter, both sides will need more dialogue, for which ASEAN has a safe space for both of them to talk and cajole, ie, the East Asia Summit in Phnom Penh, the G20 summit in Bali and the 2022 Asia Pacific leaders' meeting in Bangkok. All three summits will be held between Nov 10-19. If they so desire, they can hold many bilateral meetings in this period.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida praised the role of ASEAN in his keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue for upholding unity and centrality to ensure growth while maintaining diversity and inclusiveness. If the world's third economic power has such strong trust in ASEAN, it is about time that Asean expanded its role to reduce US-China tensions and improve their relations.

The event addressed the theme: G20 Digital Transformation: Resilient MSMEs for Global Economic Recovery&rsquo;. Dr Ing presented the key ingredients necessary to support strong and resilient MSMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, it is important that the government supports both supply- and demand-sides, like what the government of Indonesia (GOI) has provided since 2020, particularly for MSMEs in 2021. In 2020, IDR112 trillion was allocated for interest rate subsidies and tax subsidies. In 2021, the GOI allocated IDR187 trillion in corporate financing to support MSMEs to continue their operations during the pandemic. Second, the government needs to ensure that the allocated funds and assistance will be well distributed and reach the targeted beneficiaries.</p><p>Dr Ing also discussed the digital divide between countries and the integration of MSMEs into digital trade. There are three significant technological gaps: internet speed, internet usage, and technology production. Compared to developed countries, developing countries, including Indonesia, are experiencing huge technological gaps that hinder businesses, including the MSMEs, to apply digital trade. The regulatory framework provided by the government will play an important role in integrating MSMEs into digital trade through the provision of good electricity, knowledge on international market standards and service qualifications, and assistance in digital transformation.</p><p>Following Dr Ing&rsquo;s work on Indonesia&rsquo;s G20 presidency, she highlighted the global challenges in digital transformation and digital trade: privacy, cyber security, competition, and the digital divide. Dr Ing expressed the importance of having a better privacy and competition laws in supporting digital transformation as well as tackling the digital divide, especially between developed and developing countries.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:144:"/uploads/news/20220630/2022_june_the-jakarta-post-spotlight-g20-digital-transformation-resilient-msmes-for-global-economic-recovery_800x4501.png";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:5061:"The Jakarta Post Spotlight: G20 Digital Transformation: Resilient MSMEs for Global Economic Recovery The Jakarta Post Spotlight: G20 Digital Transformation: Resilient MSMEs for Global Economic Recovery Jakarta, 30 June 2022: Dr Lili Yan Ing, ERIA&rsquo;s Lead Advisor on Southeast Asia, was invited as one of the main speakers at Jakarta Post&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spotlight 12&rsquo; which is part of their Road to G20 Series, along with Dr Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Indonesia&rsquo;s Finance Minister, Dr Joan Jos&eacute; Daboub, Co-chair of B20 Task Force of Trade and Investment, and Mr Pamitra Wineka, CEO of TaniHub Group.

First, it is important that the government supports both supply- and demand-sides, like what the government of Indonesia (GOI) has provided since 2020, particularly for MSMEs in 2021. In 2020, IDR112 trillion was allocated for interest rate subsidies and tax subsidies. In 2021, the GOI allocated IDR187 trillion in corporate financing to support MSMEs to continue their operations during the pandemic. Second, the government needs to ensure that the allocated funds and assistance will be well distributed and reach the targeted beneficiaries.
Dr Ing also discussed the digital divide between countries and the integration of MSMEs into digital trade. There are three significant technological gaps: internet speed, internet usage, and technology production. Compared to developed countries, developing countries, including Indonesia, are experiencing huge technological gaps that hinder businesses, including the MSMEs, to apply digital trade. The regulatory framework provided by the government will play an important role in integrating MSMEs into digital trade through the provision of good electricity, knowledge on international market standards and service qualifications, and assistance in digital transformation.
Following Dr Ing&rsquo;s work on Indonesia&rsquo;s G20 presidency, she highlighted the global challenges in digital transformation and digital trade: privacy, cyber security, competition, and the digital divide. Dr Ing expressed the importance of having a better privacy and competition laws in supporting digital transformation as well as tackling the digital divide, especially between developed and developing countries.             2022-06-30 30 June 2022 2202 enuJ 03 03-60-2202             .seirtnuoc gnipoleved dna depoleved neewteb yllaicepse ,edivid latigid eht gnilkcat sa llew sa noitamrofsnart latigid gnitroppus ni swal noititepmoc dna ycavirp retteb a gnivah fo ecnatropmi eht desserpxe gnI rD .edivid latigid eht dna ,noititepmoc ,ytiruces rebyc ,ycavirp :edart latigid dna noitamrofsnart latigid ni segnellahc labolg eht dethgilhgih ehs ,ycnediserp 02G s;ouqsr&aisenodnI no krow s;ouqsr&gnI rD gniwolloF

These intentions are translated from the presidency&rsquo;s main theme 'Recover Together, Recover Stronger.'
The G20 Energy Transition Working Group (ETWG) organised by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Republic of Indonesia is one of the 13 working groups that are part of the sherpa track.
Working within the energy transitions pillar, the ETWG aims to strengthen global sustainable energy systems and just transitions, while accelerating efforts for achieving SDGs and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change.
The second ETWG meeting was held in Labuan Bajo, Nusa Tenggara Timur, from 23 to 24 June 2022 in hybrid format. The meeting was attended by delegates from all G20 member countries, invited countries, and several international organizations, among others are ERIA, Asian Development Bank (ADB), International Energy Agency (IEA), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Building on the ETWG&rsquo;s objectives and the findings of the first ETWG meeting organised in March in Yogyakarta, the second meeting took an important step to prepare the deliverables for the proposed G20 global deal on energy transitions focusing on the elaboration of Common Approaches to Accelerating Clean Energy Transitions (COMPACT); analysing a stocktake on the three priority areas, i.e., securingâ€¯energy accessibility, scaling up technology. &nbsp;Financingâ€¯was emphasised as a critical enabler for energy transitions, and the meeting put forth a multi-yearâ€¯roadmapâ€¯of G20 collective actions in the three priority areas and building blocks for the ministers&rsquo; communique.
ERIA was represented in person by Dr Han Phoumin and Dr Alloysius Joko Purwanto who presented on the second priority area: scaling up smart and clean energy technologies.
Discussing the theme of &lsquo;The Role of Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) and Natural Gas in G20 Region, Dr Han explained the necessity of adopting multiple pathways including CCUS as it has an important role for carbon sinks and helps to decarbonize emissions in economic sectors where abatement is challenging. The G20&rsquo;s actions can include setting up total and sectoral targets of avoided carbon dioxide emissions through CCUS, boosting research and innovation, creating more windows of financial opportunity for developing countries, improving regulations in the oil and gas sector, developing CCUS value chain networks, and continuing capacity building and knowledge sharing activities on CCUS.
Dr Phoumin concluded with a brief explanation about the Asian CCUS Network, which ERIA coordinates, as a platform that provides opportunities for countries in Asia to collaborate to build countries&rsquo; capabilities to lower the cost of CCUS technology and its deployment through the collaboration of research and innovation.
On the role of natural gas in G20, Dr Purwanto described the importance and crucial role of natural gas in fulfilling basic and universal energy needs especially in the developing and emerging economies, in ensuring energy security in the current situation marked by geopolitical tensions, and in facilitating penetration of renewable electricity and the more advanced technologies such as CCUS and energy, namely hydrogen and ammonia.
Based on that rationale, G20 actions might consist of acknowledging the pivotal role of natural gas, especially by promoting coal-to-gas switching in the power sector, as the flexible baseload for renewable electricity and in cofiring with hydrogen and/or ammonia. For the developing and emerging economies, G20&rsquo;s actions can consist of increasing financial support for natural gas development and providing capacity building to promote the creation of gas spot markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The third or the last G20 Energy Transition Working Group meeting will be held in Bali, 30 August to 1 September 2022.
With Ministerial Meetings and Engagement Groups, the Working Groups are parts of the activities and work in the framework of the Indonesia G20 Presidency. The pinnacle of the G20 process will be the 17th G20 Heads of State and Government Summit taking place in November 2022 in Bali.             2022-06-23 23 June 2022 2202 enuJ 32 32-60-2202             .ilaB ni 2202 rebmevoN ni ecalp gnikat timmuS tnemnrevoG dna etatS fo sdaeH 02G ht71 eht eb lliw ssecorp 02G eht fo elcannip ehT .ycnediserP 02G aisenodnI eht fo krowemarf eht ni krow dna seitivitca eht fo strap era spuorG gnikroW eht ,spuorG tnemegagnE dna sgniteeM lairetsiniM htiW

Presentations
In the morning session, Mr Koji Hachiyama presented on the topic of ASEAN-Japan achieving growth together through supply chain resiliency and sophistication.
He introduced ERIA activities which covers mainly economics, research, and policy recommendations. Mr Hachiyama explained that in general, the international production networks in ASEAN and East Asia are robust and resilient to COVID-19 shocks. The existing trade relationship between major customers and/or suppliers (trade robustness) and timely exchange with customers (trade resilience) contributed to companies&rsquo; performance during the pandemic. Companies that diversified customers before the COVID-19 pandemic succeed in timely changing the trade relationships with major customers.
Compared to other domestic and foreign-affiliated companies in ASEAN and East Asia, Japanese companies tend to have experienced lower performance and have lower expectations for the future. Japanese companies maintained the trade relationships with both their customers and suppliers as before the pandemic but seemed to lack the flexibility and innovation to make the most of emerging opportunities on changes in business relationships and additional increases in the existing trade. It is necessary to analyse and address the causes with proper measures.
In order to strengthen the resilience of supply chains to be responsive to future pandemics, it is essential for Japanese companies to promote the decentralisation of customers and digitisation. Furthermore, the public and private sectors of ASEAN and Japan must work together more closely to address the development of infrastructure, legal systems, the data usage environment, and human resource development, all of which are indispensable for promoting digitalisation.             2022-06-03 3 June 2022 2202 enuJ 3 30-60-2202             .noitasilatigid gnitomorp rof elbasnepsidni era hcihw fo lla ,tnempoleved ecruoser namuh dna ,tnemnorivne egasu atad eht ,smetsys lagel ,erutcurtsarfni fo tnempoleved eht sserdda ot ylesolc erom rehtegot krow tsum napaJ dna NAESA fo srotces etavirp dna cilbup eht ,eromrehtruF .noitasitigid dna sremotsuc fo noitasilartneced eht etomorp ot seinapmoc esenapaJ rof laitnesse si ti ,scimednap erutuf ot evisnopser eb ot sniahc ylppus fo ecneiliser eht nehtgnerts ot redro nI

Organised by the Petroleum Authority of Brunei Darussalam, the conference was held at the Musyawarah Hall, International Convention Centre in Bandar Seri Begawan.</p><p>Yang Mulia Awang Haji Azhar bin Haji Yahya, Permanent Secretary, Department of Energy at the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office and Interim Managing Director, Petroleum Authority of Brunei Darussalam, delivered remarks at the opening ceremony. Following the Secretary of Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office&rsquo;s speech, Professor Nishimura gave the keynote address which focused on ERIA&rsquo;s research on clean energy transition in the ASEAN region.</p><p>In his presentation, Prof Nishimura discussed ASEAN&rsquo;s carbon neutrality goals in 2050, 2060, and 2065. These targets were highlighted at COP26 which established the Glasgow Climate Pact to pursue efforts to control the world&rsquo;s average temperature and urges countries to expedite the phase-out of coal power.</p><p>ERIA and the Institute of Energy Economics Japan (IEEJ) are currently conducting a study on cost-optimal deployment of renewable energy technology for ASEAN&rsquo;s &nbsp;2060 carbon neutrality. In the short- to medium-term, efficient gas-fired power plants will reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil power generation. In this regard, natural gas will play a crucial part in a realistic mitigation strategy. In the power sector, a rising number of ASEAN countries are interested in converting from coal to natural gas. In the long-term, CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilisation Storage) and co-firing with ammonia and hydrogen will play a predominant role.</p><p>Prof Nishimura further stressed the necessity of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for mid- to long-term decarbonisation. ERIA and Japan launched the &lsquo;Asia CCUS Network&rsquo; in June 2021 with the presence of the Chair of the EAS Energy Ministers Meeting, Brunei Darussalam. Additionally, the 4th East Asia Energy Forum was successfully convened by ERIA and Brunei Darussalam in September 2021 under the theme &lsquo;A Low-Carbon Energy Transition in the ASEAN Region,&rsquo; focusing on the role of natural gas, variable renewable energy, hydrogen, ammonia, and CCUS, as well as a net-zero emissions scenario for ASEAN countries.</p><p>ERIA&rsquo;s research work including the Asia CCUS Network and the 4th East Asia Energy Forum were strongly welcomed by the leaders. Professor Nishimura also extended his sincere gratitude to Brunei Darussalam for the country&rsquo;s strong support towards carbon neutrality. The ASEAN region should advocate for a gradual, realistic energy transition with available financing.</p><p>Prof Nishimura underscored ERIA&rsquo;s willingness to support ASEAN countries with their energy transition efforts.

Organised by the Petroleum Authority of Brunei Darussalam, the conference was held at the Musyawarah Hall, International Convention Centre in Bandar Seri Begawan.
Yang Mulia Awang Haji Azhar bin Haji Yahya, Permanent Secretary, Department of Energy at the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office and Interim Managing Director, Petroleum Authority of Brunei Darussalam, delivered remarks at the opening ceremony. Following the Secretary of Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office&rsquo;s speech, Professor Nishimura gave the keynote address which focused on ERIA&rsquo;s research on clean energy transition in the ASEAN region.
In his presentation, Prof Nishimura discussed ASEAN&rsquo;s carbon neutrality goals in 2050, 2060, and 2065. These targets were highlighted at COP26 which established the Glasgow Climate Pact to pursue efforts to control the world&rsquo;s average temperature and urges countries to expedite the phase-out of coal power.
ERIA and the Institute of Energy Economics Japan (IEEJ) are currently conducting a study on cost-optimal deployment of renewable energy technology for ASEAN&rsquo;s &nbsp;2060 carbon neutrality. In the short- to medium-term, efficient gas-fired power plants will reduce CO2 emissions from fossil power generation. In this regard, natural gas will play a crucial part in a realistic mitigation strategy. In the power sector, a rising number of ASEAN countries are interested in converting from coal to natural gas. In the long-term, CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilisation Storage) and co-firing with ammonia and hydrogen will play a predominant role.
Prof Nishimura further stressed the necessity of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for mid- to long-term decarbonisation. ERIA and Japan launched the &lsquo;Asia CCUS Network&rsquo; in June 2021 with the presence of the Chair of the EAS Energy Ministers Meeting, Brunei Darussalam. Additionally, the 4th East Asia Energy Forum was successfully convened by ERIA and Brunei Darussalam in September 2021 under the theme &lsquo;A Low-Carbon Energy Transition in the ASEAN Region,&rsquo; focusing on the role of natural gas, variable renewable energy, hydrogen, ammonia, and CCUS, as well as a net-zero emissions scenario for ASEAN countries.
ERIA&rsquo;s research work including the Asia CCUS Network and the 4th East Asia Energy Forum were strongly welcomed by the leaders. Professor Nishimura also extended his sincere gratitude to Brunei Darussalam for the country&rsquo;s strong support towards carbon neutrality. The ASEAN region should advocate for a gradual, realistic energy transition with available financing.
Prof Nishimura underscored ERIA&rsquo;s willingness to support ASEAN countries with their energy transition efforts. On top of that, ERIA has a plan to promote energy-saving and new energy research projects including green hydrogen in Brunei Darussalam this year. Lastly, Professor Nishimura hoped that the energy symposium would mark a valuable step towards a secure, reliable, sustainable, and affordable energy transition in the region.&nbsp;
The symposium was also attended by Yang Mulia Dato Seri Paduka Awang Haji Matsatejo bin Sokiaw, Deputy Minister, Department of Energy, Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office, as well as government officials, industry executives, intergovernmental organisations, academics, and experts from Brunei Darussalam.

COVID-19 has magnified gender-based inequalities in health and healthcare, creating a more urgent need to understand the forces undermining women&rsquo;s well-being and resilience.
The Asian Network, in partnership with ERIA, held a virtual conference on &lsquo;The Future of Health Innovation in Asia&rsquo; on 16th June 2022. The virtual conference gathered 15 speakers from Asia to share their expertise in Health and Healthcare, Entrepreneurship, and Technology for Social Good. During the first session, &lsquo;HealthTech which Future in Asia?&rsquo;, the speakers shared their insights on innovation and technology, the role of private sector and gender equality and femtech concluding that the disruption of healthcare ecosystem caused by COVID 19 has accelerated growth in the healthcare industry and there is still a need to define healthcare polices which have narrow gaps between policy approaches and on the ground realities.

The second session discussed &lsquo;Good Health and Wellbeing&rsquo;. The speakers shared their perceptions and experiences on mental health in the workplace and daily life focusing on what makes people happy including &nbsp;mental health awareness and education/curriculum issues. Furthermore, the difference between empathetic listening contrasted with regular conversation and how it is important in the workplace were discussed.

The third session was about &lsquo;Womens&rsquo; Health&rsquo;. During the discussion, the high maternal mortality in some Asian countries was presented as was the importance of the relationship between womens&rsquo; health and education and economic empowerment.

The fourth session talked about &lsquo;Shifting demographics and Lifestyle in Asia&rsquo;. Speakers talked about intergenerational trauma and relationships in general. Experiences on China and Australia were heard during the discussion. The effect of Covid 19 on the speakers&rsquo; respective businesses and their key learnings and recommendations were discussed. One panelist commented that &lsquo;Because of the pandemic, everything has changed. Now, Business is all about Change and Change is all about Challenges. We must be as resilient as possible.&rsquo; Additionally, how to support elderly patients with the help of artificial intelligence and technological innovation and the importance of the relationship between a person&rsquo;s happiness and health were also raised during the discussion.             2022-06-16 16 June 2022 2202 enuJ 61 61-60-2202             .noissucsid eht gnirud desiar osla erew htlaeh dna ssenippah s;ouqsr&nosrep a neewteb pihsnoitaler eht fo ecnatropmi eht dna noitavonni lacigolonhcet dna ecnegilletni laicifitra fo pleh eht htiw stneitap ylredle troppus ot woh ,yllanoitiddA ;ouqsr&.elbissop sa tneiliser sa eb tsum eW .segnellahC tuoba lla si egnahC dna egnahC tuoba lla si ssenisuB ,woN .degnahc sah gnihtyreve ,cimednap eht fo esuaceB;ouqsl& taht detnemmoc tsilenap enO .dessucsid erew snoitadnemmocer dna sgninrael yek rieht dna sessenisub evitcepser ;ouqsr&srekaeps eht no 91 divoC fo tceffe ehT .noissucsid eht gnirud draeh erew ailartsuA dna anihC no secneirepxE .lareneg ni spihsnoitaler dna amuart lanoitarenegretni tuoba deklat srekaepS .;ouqsr&aisA ni elytsefiL dna scihpargomed gnitfihS;ouqsl& tuoba deklat noisses htruof ehT

The challenges in front of us are global in nature and require large scale, innovative solutions. Thus it makes sense for ASEAN and the EU to find new ways to form connections and build stronger relations.</p><p>With these goals in mind, Mr Tomasz Poreba, Member of the EU Parliament and President of New Directions think tank, visited ERIA during his recent trip to Jakarta. He was accompanied by Mr Witold de Chevilly, the Executive Director of New Directions, and Arum Pudyolaksono, Third Secretary, Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia &ndash; Brussels.

The challenges in front of us are global in nature and require large scale, innovative solutions. Thus it makes sense for ASEAN and the EU to find new ways to form connections and build stronger relations.
With these goals in mind, Mr Tomasz Poreba, Member of the EU Parliament and President of New Directions think tank, visited ERIA during his recent trip to Jakarta. He was accompanied by Mr Witold de Chevilly, the Executive Director of New Directions, and Arum Pudyolaksono, Third Secretary, Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia &ndash; Brussels. They were greeted by Mr Koji Hachiyama, ERIA&rsquo;s COO, accompanied by ERIA staff and experts.&nbsp;
The conversation explored several topics including digitalization, energy, trade, and education and how the two regions can work together to build brighter futures for the people of both regions. Mr Hachiyama thanked Mr Poreba for his interest in ERIA.

After the U.S. and China, India is the world&rsquo;s third-largest consumer of oil, over 80% of which is imported, and oil and food prices have always haunted the Indian economy.&nbsp;
Two months into the conflict, faced with a steep upward movement of oil prices, with a projection to touch upon $140 per barrel, India&rsquo;s business leaders and policymakers are seriously evaluating the impact of this crisis just as business has started to come out of the pandemic.

India imports about 2% of its oil needs and $1 billion worth of coal from Russia per year.

The topic is G20 Smart World Living Lab (G2SWL) Recover Together, Recover Stronger: Improving Quality of Life. G2SWL is a proposed living laboratory to solve problems in small areas (cities, districts, villages, campuses, roads, etc.) and real-life conditions.
With the rise and implementation of digital transformation that is making a huge change in society, urban development is forced to adopt smart city as an approach to solve problems through innovative ways of increasing people&rsquo;s quality of life.
The main objectives of this activity are 1) improve the quality of life; 2) solve problems or maximise the potential of provinces, cities, and rural areas on a small scale; 3) continuously evaluate real problems and actual conditions; 4) provide the prototype of technology, governance, and human resource development; 5) provide a sandbox for start-ups; 6) establish a knowledge centre to deliver problem-solving recommendations for G20 and other countries; and 7) make laboratory-based sharing into a learning hub.
G2SWL is inviting collaboration from the government, industries, academia, and citizens to establish a living lab that can solve problems based on their expertise, which include but are not limited to 1) establishment of office administrations and virtual labs as centres of research; 2) provision of governance and regulation research; 3) human capital (digital literacy development); 4) provision of smart solutions for economic, industry, and environment services; and 5) a sandbox for start-ups that can be managed in a living lab area.             2022-06-07 7 June 2022 2202 enuJ 7 70-60-2202             .aera bal gnivil a ni deganam eb nac taht spu-trats rof xobdnas a )5 dna ;secivres tnemnorivne dna ,yrtsudni ,cimonoce rof snoitulos trams fo noisivorp )4 ;)tnempoleved ycaretil latigid( latipac namuh )3 ;hcraeser noitaluger dna ecnanrevog fo noisivorp )2 ;hcraeser fo sertnec sa sbal lautriv dna snoitartsinimda eciffo fo tnemhsilbatse )1 ot detimil ton era tub edulcni hcihw ,esitrepxe rieht no desab smelborp evlos nac taht bal gnivil a hsilbatse ot snezitic dna ,aimedaca ,seirtsudni ,tnemnrevog eht morf noitaroballoc gnitivni si LWS2G

As both are Asean's comprehensive strategic partners, they are not supposed to confront each other. Together they could become more cooperative counterparts. There are common areas in which they could work together for the benefit of third parties, Asean in particular.
Now, several projects involving these two countries and related to Asean are in limbo, especially on supply chain resilience, digital technology, connectivity and the climate crisis.
Fast forward from Down Under to Northeast Asia, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol minced no words when he assumed the top position early last month, stating that he would strengthen the alliance with the US to deter any external threat against the world's No.10 economy. Bilaterally it is not difficult to do so.
However, the US strategic imperative in Northeast Asia requires South Korea to also improve ties with its other ally, Japan. At the moment, South Korea-Japan ties are at their lowest ebb with both sides having yet to overcome an impasse over historical legacies.
However, it was heartening that during his recent visit to attend the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue in Tokyo, Mr Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged that both sides would try their best to tackle their painful past. Any improvement between Seoul and Tokyo would further boost US security ties with Northeast Asia's two top allies.
Together, they would strengthen security in the most volatile part of the world, as North Korea continues to push more aggressively on nuclearisation and intercontinental missile tests.
Interestingly enough, Mr Yoon was pragmatic in offering an olive branch to Pyongyang that if it decides to denuclearise totally, South Korea and the international community would provide an audacious plan to reform its economy and modernise the Marxist-Leninist state. It is a carrot and stick strategy and one that has been used previously by his predecessors. But it has not so far yielded any positive and lasting outcome. It remains to be seen if it will be different this time around.
One area that needs to be established is the new South Korean government's stance toward Asean. Under the previous government, Asean was elevated to the same level as the US, China, Japan and Russia. Asean-Korea relations were guided by the New Southern Policy and its modifications, known as the New Southern Policy Plus (NSPP).

Mr Yoon should continue to further promote NSPP in order to maintain the country's foreign policy consistency, which used to be the country's weakest link with Asean.
For Asean, the new Filipino president, Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr, will bring a breath of fresh air to the Philippines' relations with both China and the US. Before the election, Bongbong met one on one with Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian. After the polls, the envoy said that Philippines-China relations will be stronger.
Regarding US ties, political pundits believe that Bongbong would choose to strengthen the alliance with the US but remain friendly to China. Unlike his predecessor who had a rudderless policy on US and China, Bongbong is likely to be more consistent in pursuing ties with both superpowers. Balancing ties with the two would be a preferred policy for the Philippines. Bongbong should be able to generate a good rapport with Asean leaders and bring the Philippines closer to the group. That would mean more consultations and common decisions with the bloc, especially on issues related to the South China Sea.
At a face-to-face working group meeting on the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea (COC) held in Siem Reap on May 24-26, held after a two-year gap because of Covid-19, the Filipino delegates were notably more active and stressed the importance of the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in July 2016. This was the first indicator of the new administration's attitude toward the COC negotiations.
Washington and Beijing are watching closely how the Bongbong administration will handle COC negotiations in the coming months with a new round planned for July in Cambodia. At this juncture, Manila still insists on including the statement on the 40th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) in the planned document, to be issued by the Asean chair, to mark the 20th anniversary of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) at the Asean-related summits in November.

All in all, in a post-Covid world, leadership changes in any country in the Indo-Pacific region will have an unavoidable ripple effect on US-China rivalries as both powers have extensive security and economic networks.

That was the conclusion from the nine hours of discussions from May 9-10 in Washington between their senior foreign affairs and defence officials.
The outcome was not groundbreaking but it did reaffirm that the Thailand-US alliance is still relevant after several years of inertia and instability. To maintain one of the oldest military alliances in the world is not easy as there is historical baggage that both sides have to confront and come to terms with.
Lest we forget, Thailand was the first Asian country to establish ties with the United States. Next year the two countries will commemorate the 190th anniversary of their economic ties, which began when the US signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1833. Unofficial contact began even earlier, in the late 1810s.
Although the country is one of the oldest US allies in the Indo-Pacific region, the relationship between Thailand and the US has gone through ups and downs since the end of the Cold War. In the absence of the communist threat from the Soviet Union, Washington bypassed Bangkok and instead zeroed in on Thailand's neighbours, which share a more similar strategic outlook towards the rise of China.

In fact, in the early days of the Biden administration, Thailand was slammed by the US security agencies over its supposed intimate relations with China, with American lawmakers often lamenting Thailand's lack of a clear policy position on issues concerning US interests.
In contrast, Singapore and Vietnam have consistently been the US's strategic focus, due to their stronger support of Washington's stance on the region's flashpoint issues.

When the Free and Open Indo-Pacific policy was officially announced last year, Washington seemingly changed its views on Thailand, which allowed the country to return to the US's strategic fold. President Joe Biden's priority, after all, is strengthening its allies and their institutions.
It should be noted that since the signing of the Thanat-Rusk communique in 1962, Thai-US security cooperation has not wavered -- in fact, it has continued to grow and mature as a result of the nations' shared strategic vision. Despite the roller-coaster ride that was the past decade, for instance, there was no significant change in Thai-US security programmes.
More recently, Foreign Affairs permanent secretary Thani Thongphakdi and Defence permanent secretary Warakiat Rattananont chaired the inaugural Thailand-US Strategic and Defence Dialogue in Washington, along with US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink, and Assistant Secretary of Defence for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Ely Ratner.
The dialogue was held after officials from the Thai Foreign Ministry and US State Department met for the 8th Thailand-US Strategic Dialogue, while Thai and American senior defence officials met at the 7th Thailand-US Defence Strategic Talks.
Thailand is a latecomer as far as the so-called 2x2 strategic dialogue is concerned. All other US allies in Indo-Pacific have long enjoyed the benefits of the dialogue format. The inaugural dialogue with Thailand was requested by the US, indicating Washington's strong desire to strengthen existing cooperation and mechanisms to address new global and regional challenges, in particular recent developments in the Russia-Ukraine war, and Myanmar's crisis, among others.
Throughout the intensive nine-hour meetings, the two sides discussed "every issue on their mind" to enhance their strategic partnership in all aspects, ranging from political and security cooperation to the economic partnership, to deepening people-to-people ties, as well as promoting a peaceful and stable environment conducive to the socio-economic recovery from Covid-19.
In addition, they also debated the current global challenges and regional strategic landscape, promoted cooperation at the sub-regional and regional levels, particularly Asean-US cooperation, and agreed to enhance development cooperation in the Mekong sub-region through the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (Acmecs) and the Mekong-US Partnership (Musp).
Thailand also wishes to see the operationalisation of Asean Outlook on the Indo Pacific (AOIP) which is inclusive in nature. Along with Indonesia, Thailand as the Asean chair in 2019 pushed successfully for the adoption of AOIP as a guideline to engage external powers in four key areas: maritime cooperation, connectivity, sustainable development and economic affairs. Even before the meeting, Washington expressed the wish to synergise its Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy with AOIP.
Concerning regional and international issues, both sides touched on the Myanmar crisis, the Russia-Ukraine war and the situation in South China Sea. They discussed and shared both common and divergent views. Thailand briefed the US on the situation in Myanmar and the ongoing humanitarian efforts by Thailand as well as Asean for those affected by the conflict inside Myanmar and along the Thai-Myanmar border.
On the situation in Ukraine, Thailand agreed to support diplomatic means to end the war and called for sustainable humanitarian assistance to victims of the conflicts. Thailand and Asean stand ready to provide any immediate assistance, the meeting was told.
The dialogue also sought to highlight the Thailand-US comprehensive economic partnership.

It is also the main theme of this year's Apec summit, of which Thailand is the current chair.
In addition, they discussed how to further strengthen their multi-faceted bilateral cooperation, including the setting up of a joint working group to organise a series of public activities to promote people-to-people relations ahead of the 190th anniversary of Thai-US diplomatic relations.
On top of strengthening cooperation, the two countries also focused on modern-day non-traditional challenges, such as cyber security, maritime security, counter-terrorism, transnational crime, health security and the climate crisis.
The meeting also discussed this year's Apec summit agenda, which Thailand is hosting, as well as the planned transition to the US as Apec chair and host next year. Thailand is hopeful that President Biden will visit Thailand and attend the Apec leaders' meeting in November.

It also allows for mutual recognition of professional qualifications, with obligations and frameworks for increased cooperation.

With over 170 participants, the webinar discussed key strategies to unlock the full potential of RCEP by understanding the opportunities and challenges of services in Cambodia with trade experts, the private sector, and government.</p><p>The webinar was opened by H.E.

Mr Kay Lot, Business Owner of QED, YellowTree Co.

She also noted the importance of providing greater access of information to relevant players for maximising RCEP utilisation. Mr Harrison White, CEO, Cambodia Investment Review (CIR Media) discussed the importance of providing transparent regulations to allow service sector companies in Cambodia to grow. He also noted the importance of qualified human resources to support a competitive workforce.

Nothing else would matter. When South Korea was admitted as a dialogue partner in 1989, officials dealing with ASEAN-Korea relations had to work hard to engage each other beyond the crisis on the Korean Peninsula.<br class="read" /></span><span class="read"><br class="read" /></span><span class="read">In retrospect, it has been a high learning curve on both sides to really understand each other&#039;s strategic environment and mutual interests. Gone are the days when the number of missiles tested and fired including diplomatic responses would top the agenda. Today, ASEAN-Korea relations cover a plethora of issues ranging from economic, political, security, socio-cultural and environmental to health security as well as people-to-people connections. They reflect the nature and scope of their comprehensive partnership.<br class="read" /></span><span class="read"><br class="read" /></span><span class="read">Former President Moon Jae-in&#039;s bold diplomatic initiative known as the New Southern Policy (NSP) has done much to propel South Korea from the backseat to the front row of the grouping&#039;s dialogue partners since its launch in 2017. The NSP provides the much needed consistency and continuity of South Korea&#039;s engagement with ASEAN. Most importantly, NSP elevates ASEAN to the rank of major powers such as the U.S., China, Japan and Russia. No previous administrations in Seoul gave such a high-level strategic value to ASEAN as the Moon government.<br class="read" /></span><span class="read"><br class="read" /></span><span class="read">Credit must go to Moon&#039;s leadership and his commitment to strengthening ties with ASEAN, both at government and personal levels through the NSP.

Nothing else would matter. When South Korea was admitted as a dialogue partner in 1989, officials dealing with ASEAN-Korea relations had to work hard to engage each other beyond the crisis on the Korean Peninsula.In retrospect, it has been a high learning curve on both sides to really understand each other's strategic environment and mutual interests. Gone are the days when the number of missiles tested and fired including diplomatic responses would top the agenda. Today, ASEAN-Korea relations cover a plethora of issues ranging from economic, political, security, socio-cultural and environmental to health security as well as people-to-people connections. They reflect the nature and scope of their comprehensive partnership.Former President Moon Jae-in's bold diplomatic initiative known as the New Southern Policy (NSP) has done much to propel South Korea from the backseat to the front row of the grouping's dialogue partners since its launch in 2017. The NSP provides the much needed consistency and continuity of South Korea's engagement with ASEAN. Most importantly, NSP elevates ASEAN to the rank of major powers such as the U.S., China, Japan and Russia. No previous administrations in Seoul gave such a high-level strategic value to ASEAN as the Moon government.Credit must go to Moon's leadership and his commitment to strengthening ties with ASEAN, both at government and personal levels through the NSP. Besides visiting all ASEAN countries in the first two years in office, Moon also spent time and effort cementing personal relationships with the ASEAN leaders. Moon's frequent visits to and dialogue with ASEAN also promoted better awareness and understanding among the Korean public about ASEAN. It must be noted that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, ASEAN-Korea ties have proceeded without any stumbling blocks.It would be wise for the administration of newly elected President Yoon Suk-yeol to further strengthen and expand the NSP. Given the dramatic shifts in the regional and global strategic environment in recent months, it is high time that the ASEAN-Korea ties became more strategic, covering broader issues that would ensure the rules-based order, peace and stability in this part of the world.Although South Korea does not yet have its own Indo-Pacific framework, the NSP can serve as a platform to synergize with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) in the near future. AOIP's guidelines are inclusive and aimed at promoting cooperation and avoiding confrontation. ASEAN has already picked four areas of priority, namely maritime cooperation, sustainable development, connectivity and economic cooperation.Granted the current goodwill on both sides, ASEAN and South Korea can identify areas of cooperation and start the ball rolling. The NSP provides the platform for ASEAN to strengthen cooperation in sustainable social and economic development and better livelihoods. During the COVID-19 pandemic, South Korea's efficient public health policies and measures have served as models for Southeast Asia.Under Moon, South Korea has also fine-tuned its development policy toward the Mekong sub-region, which has distinguished itself from other numerous plans. Today, Seoul is a major player in one of the world's most bio-diverse regions, providing strong financial and capacity-building support to lower riparian countries. The current Mekong-Korea action plan is comprehensive in addressing issues related to the region's well-being encompassing people, prosperity and peace.With the NSP pathway, South Korea's future trajectory in Southeast Asia will remain dynamic and a way forward. Without any historical baggage, Seoul is well positioned to maximize all round cooperation simultaneously with Southeast Asia. At this juncture, Korean soft power, through its brand known as K-related culture has been well received without causing any local resentment. Southeast Asian talents have also reached global fame through Korean coaching and tutelage. As such, the NSP could be implemented in multi-pronged ways without jeopardy while the people-to-people connections through education, cultural exchanges and know-how would further instill Korea in the hearts of Southeast Asia.

Prof Arima added that the ASEAN countries are making vigorous efforts for an energy transition toward carbon neutrality and need to explore a variety of options and utilize all fuels and all technologies in pursuing their respective carbon neutrality goals.</p><p>Each Governing Board Member presented their views on the impacts of recent global developments on the ASEAN/East Asia region.

His Excellency added that accelerating regional economic integration is one of the top priorities in supporting recovery and sustainable economic development and encouraged ERIA to continue providing support in terms of policy options and capacity building, focusing on effectively implementing the commitments in the free trade agreements, particularly RCEP.</p><p>Dr Teguh Dartanto, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Business of the University of Indonesia, appreciated ERIA for supporting Indonesia in the G20 Presidency and expected that ERIA would continue to support Indonesia&rsquo;s Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2023. The three key strategic issues of the ASEAN chairmanship are economic recovery, digital economy, and sustainability, which are in line with ERIA&rsquo;s work. Dr Alan Bollard, Professor of Practice at the Victoria Business School, also congratulated ERIA for the excellent work programs that it was able to sustain during the very turbulent year, particularly noting the excellent use of the webinars and social media which really move the results of the research to a wide community.</p><p>Dr Cielito F Habito, the Chairperson of the Governing Board who moderated this meeting, in his Closing Remarks mentioned that not even a world-paralyzing pandemic can stop ERIA from providing essential knowledge to our region and to our individual governments and national stakeholders, as we all work together for Asia and the Pacific.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:88:"/uploads/news/20220602/2022_june_eria-holds-the-15th-governing-board-meeting-800x450.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:10537:"ERIA Holds the 15th ERIA Governing Board Meeting ERIA Holds the 15th ERIA Governing Board Meeting Jakarta, 2 June 2022: The 15th ERIA Governing Board meeting was held on 2 June 2022.

This was followed by the presentations by Prof Fukunari Kimura, Chief Economist of ERIA and Prof Jun Arima, ERIA&rsquo;s Senior Policy Fellow for Energy and Environment providing further background, context, and insights on ERIA&rsquo;s research activities including the energy field.
Prof Kimura highlighted three key points: (1) the rules-based trading regime will be challenged; (2) technologies will expand the scope of globalization at the same time; and (3) ASEAN and East Asia should still believe in globalization for rapid, innovative, inclusive, and sustainable economic development. Prof Arima added that the ASEAN countries are making vigorous efforts for an energy transition toward carbon neutrality and need to explore a variety of options and utilize all fuels and all technologies in pursuing their respective carbon neutrality goals.
Each Governing Board Member presented their views on the impacts of recent global developments on the ASEAN/East Asia region. H.E. Mr Ros Seilava, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Cambodia and Member of the Supreme National Economic Council (SNEC) specifically thanked ERIA for supporting Cambodia&rsquo;s ASEAN chairmanship, as well as expanding the scope of research and technical assistance that contributed to the formulation and implementation of ASEAN economic priority. His Excellency added that accelerating regional economic integration is one of the top priorities in supporting recovery and sustainable economic development and encouraged ERIA to continue providing support in terms of policy options and capacity building, focusing on effectively implementing the commitments in the free trade agreements, particularly RCEP.
Dr Teguh Dartanto, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Business of the University of Indonesia, appreciated ERIA for supporting Indonesia in the G20 Presidency and expected that ERIA would continue to support Indonesia&rsquo;s Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2023. The three key strategic issues of the ASEAN chairmanship are economic recovery, digital economy, and sustainability, which are in line with ERIA&rsquo;s work. Dr Alan Bollard, Professor of Practice at the Victoria Business School, also congratulated ERIA for the excellent work programs that it was able to sustain during the very turbulent year, particularly noting the excellent use of the webinars and social media which really move the results of the research to a wide community.
Dr Cielito F Habito, the Chairperson of the Governing Board who moderated this meeting, in his Closing Remarks mentioned that not even a world-paralyzing pandemic can stop ERIA from providing essential knowledge to our region and to our individual governments and national stakeholders, as we all work together for Asia and the Pacific.             2022-06-02 2 June 2022 2202 enuJ 2 20-60-2202             .cificaP eht dna aisA rof rehtegot krow lla ew sa ,sredlohekats lanoitan dna stnemnrevog laudividni ruo ot dna noiger ruo ot egdelwonk laitnesse gnidivorp morf AIRE pots nac cimednap gnizylarap-dlrow a neve ton taht denoitnem skrameR gnisolC sih ni ,gniteem siht detaredom ohw draoB gninrevoG eht fo nosrepriahC eht ,otibaH F otileiC rD

However, the ways in which the unusual strategic circumstances and tensions could further shape the trajectory of ASEAN-US relations remain to be seen. With the new schedule of the May 12-13 summit in Washington DC and the fresh developments on the ground at home and abroad, the summit will be conducted in a very cautious manner to prevent any spill-over effects or unintended consequences. Indeed, there is a high level of scepticism among the Asean members as to what the US has up its sleeve. The American gung-ho rhetoric has been quite worrisome.</p><p>One week before the much-awaited summit, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand issued a joint statement reminding the international community that as hosts of three important summits in November, they should be given the chance to do their job without any pressure or interference from external powers. It was an unprecedented move.</p><p>It is an open secret that Indonesia, the chair of the G20, has been under severe pressure from the US and its allies to limit or even suspend Russia&#039;s presence at the G20 summit following its invasion of Ukraine. Indonesian President Jokowi Widodo, popularly known as &#039;Jokowi&#039;, faces a Catch-22 situation. But as the world&#039;s third-largest democracy, openly endorsed by Washington as a beacon of democratic model for developing countries, Jakarta has to do its bidding -- a la Javanese style.</p><p>Indonesia has not followed in the West&#039;s footsteps. As a major force in the regional and Muslim world, Indonesia has maintained a strictly non-aligned posture since its independence. Within Asean, different views toward Russia are also deep-rooted, especially in former Indochinese countries. Only Vietnam and Laos abstained from the March 3 UN General Assembly resolution to condemn the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>However, to ensure the US participation led by President Joe Biden at the G20 summit in Bali on Nov 15-16, Jakarta caved into Washington&#039;s overture and invited Ukraine as the guest of the host, which came after Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi visited France, the United Kingdom, and Turkey. On his own, Jokowi also initiated phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&#039;s Volodymyr Zelensky to extend his invitations. He said Mr Putin promised to attend the G20 summit.</p><p>Washington has focused on the G20 due to its enormous influence on global economies and finance. The Biden administration and EU want to sever Russia as much as possible from international economic links to weaken its ability to wage war in Ukraine and elsewhere. These joint sanctions have already directly impacted lives throughout the world, not to mention in Southeast Asia. For instance, interest rates, inflation and food and fuel prices in Thailand and elsewhere in the region have surged.</p><p>Jakarta has been very concerned that there could be spillover effects from the US&#039;s active policy in the Ukraine war as Washington seeks further support from Asean. As a coordinating country for Asean-US relations, Jakarta is the key player, apart from the Asean chair, in shaping the optics and narratives of the upcoming special summit. There is another concern: whether Washington will extend pressure to the two other Asean hosts that have ready invited Russia to take part.</p><p>From the regional perspective, all three hosts would like to have all invited leaders, especially Mr Biden and Mr Putin, stopover in their capitals. After all, it would be the first opportunity in two years for global players to meet face to face and mingle as the Covid-10 pandemic has subsided. But the trio also realises that it is almost impossible that their guests will be able to attend all their summits, which will last a total of 10 days. Like it or not, they will pick and choose depending on their schedules and other considerations. So far, only China has signalled that its leaders will attend all the summits.</p><p>It is no wonder that high anxiety currently prevails in Phnom Penh and Bangkok as to whether Mr Biden will come to mainland Southeast Asia at all. Normally, confirmation of a US presidential visit will come very late. Therefore, at the moment there is only speculation. In Cambodia, Mr Biden would come as the president wants to ramp up ties with Asean and follow up on his Indo-Pacific strategies and promise of new economic links for investment in infrastructure. As the next Apec chair, Mr Biden will also have to take up the baton from Thailand so his presence is necessary. In 2003, when former President George W Bush attended the Apec leaders&#039; meeting in Bangkok, he also made a state visit as the guest of the late King Bhumibhol Adulyadej The Great.</p><p>One caveat is in the order given the current volatile situation; any trans-continental flights could be subjected to change at the last minute. One more question remains unanswered so far: Will Mr Biden travel after the mid-term elections in the US Congress scheduled for Nov 8? It all depends on the domestic situation. In 2013, Barack Obama skipped the Asean summit in Brunei Darussalam due to a US government shutdown after promising to come.</p><p>This time around the Cambodian chair, Prime Minister Hun Sen, hopes to host Mr Biden in Phnom Penh since it will be his last grandstand before he retires from politics. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Hun Sen surprised the regional and international community with the decision to condemn the invasion, a break from fellow Indochinese countries Vietnam and Laos, which abstained in the March vote.</p><p>Among the Asean members, the debate on the Russia-Ukraine conflict in Thailand has been the loudest due to the domestic political situation. In the past two months, the war of words among opposing groups over the Ukraine conflict has been over the top. Russia has gained support from the conservatives while the younger and liberal-minded generation backs Ukraine. They also want their country to condemn Russia as the West has done.</p><p>At the moment, Indonesia and the National Security Council are still working on their joint vision statement, which will be released on Friday. As of last week, both sides have generally agreed on all issues related to the whole gamut of their bilateral relations on economic, social, cultural, education, and climate change, among others. However, they have yet to agree on three key issues -- the Ukraine crisis, Myanmar and the South China Sea. They highlighted the divergent views among the Asean members and their American counterparts.</p><p>Asean&#039;s positions on Ukraine are clear -- supporting the UN charter, sovereignty and territorial integrity, calling for an immediate ceasefire, and providing humanitarian aid. Most importantly, they are trying to avoid the severe impacts on their economic recovery post-Covid-19 and the Ukraine conflict. The final wording will be vetted by Asean foreign ministers ahead of the summit, replacing Malaysia&#039;s call for a special Asean summit to show their solidarity.</p><p>In the case of Myanmar, Asean will stick to its five-point consensus (5PC) adopted last April. Asean held a consultative meeting last week among stakeholders from Asean, special UN agencies and nongovernmental organisations to work out a comprehensive humanitarian plan. Currently, nearly one million Myanmar people have been displaced internally in the past 15 months following the Feb 1 coup. they are in need of urgent assistance from abroad.</p><p>As far as the situation in the South China Sea is concerned, Asean and the US are on the same page as they are committed to freedom of the seas, open waterways, the unimpeded flow of lawful maritime commerce, governed by international law consistent with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. In addition, both sides will reaffirm the need to enhance mutual trust and confidence, exercise self-restraint to avoid escalating disputes, and affect peace and stability.</p><p>Their joint stands would also emphasise the importance of non-militarisation and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities by claimants and all other states, including those mentioned in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), which could further complicate the situation and escalate tensions in the South China Sea. Asean will commemorate the 20th anniversary of the DOC at the Asean summit in November.</p><p>In the draft joint vision statement, one new element related to the maritime domain could be the US pledge to promote the Asean members&#039; ability to conserve, sustainably develop and effectively manage their maritime natural resources in accordance with international law.</p><p>The joint statement by the three members is designed to send a strong signal to the Biden administration that collectively Asean will not take sides even though individually, each member does have its own positions with variations.

One week before the much-awaited summit, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand issued a joint statement reminding the international community that as hosts of three important summits in November, they should be given the chance to do their job without any pressure or interference from external powers. It was an unprecedented move.
It is an open secret that Indonesia, the chair of the G20, has been under severe pressure from the US and its allies to limit or even suspend Russia's presence at the G20 summit following its invasion of Ukraine.

On May 6, the Asean special envoy to Myanmar, the Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Prak Sokhonn, is holding a high-level platform for Asean to kick off a multi-stakeholder dialogue and to find the best practical ways to provide the grouping's humanitarian assistance to Myanmar.

In addition, Asean is expected to deliver another US$7 million of additional supplies to Myanmar during the first half of this year.
At the moment, the Asean Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Center) is working on the phase two approach to sustaining life, which will zero in on broader humanitarian needs inside Myanmar. Since this pivotal step is dealing with people in need, all activities and programmes must be non-discriminatory and independent.
When the Asean special envoy visited Myanmar in March, the military junta in Nay Pyi Taw agreed with his proposal to hold a consultative meeting on humanitarian assistance in Phnom Penh in the coming week.
The one-day meeting will be attended by senior officials from all Asean members as well as other specialised UN agencies and civil society organisations. The purpose is to jump-start a multi-stakeholder dialogue to come up with recommendations to guide Asean's humanitarian assistance to Myanmar in the weeks and months to come.

The objective is to reach a common understanding and explore the possibility of improving the Asean framework such as the humanitarian corridor arrangement in Myanmar. This is a sensitive subject as all concerned parties lack mutual trust.

Furthermore, the meeting will also discuss various challenges on the ground that the Jakarta-based AHA Center will encounter during the efforts to provide the much-needed aid. One of the pressing issues that Asean must address is how to facilitate the administration of Covid-19 vaccines in Myanmar. The State Administration Council has already inoculated 42% of the population. The number could speedily increase if the situation is calmer with more cooperation from public health officials.

The final session will be reserved for the dialogue partners. They will be updated with the latest progress and future plans to provide humanitarian assistance to Myanmar. Essentially, Asean is soliciting assistance from foreign partners.
Indeed, to speed up jabs for all communities in Myanmar, assistance from local and foreign partners is needed. Specialised UN agencies and international non-government organisations could work together with local authorities. Further negotiations are needed.
Lest we forgot, last October these issues were discussed at the multi-stakeholder meeting in Bangkok on the provision of humanitarian assistance for the people of Myanmar. It was the first attempt to garner support from the international community. Dozens of representatives from specialised UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Thai Red Cross, non-governmental organisations and civil society groups attended.
At the Phnom Penh meeting, Thailand, as Myanmar's eastern neighbour with a 2,401-kilometre common border, will have an important role to play as, because of its location, it will be serving as a hub for humanitarian assistance. Since the coup, the Thai authorities have been exploring possible cooperation with various partners and stakeholders to address the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar in a comprehensive manner. So far, the assistance has been confined to the border areas and to those who fled across to Thailand.
The Thai Red Cross Society remains the key local organisation, in cooperation with provincial public units, in providing humanitarian and medical aid to Myanmar's people. Currently, there are numerous challenges that all stakeholders have to address.

The Asian Network is a digital community dedicated to connecting like-minded individuals who can empower each other to make a positive impact within their communities and inspire the younger generation through speakers&rsquo; series, webinars, and virtual conferences.</p><p>The awardees for 2022 were Dr Darren Chua (Singapore) for disability awareness, Mr Ali Fayez (Afghanistan) for peace, Dr Skye Kinder (Australia) for health, Ms Saijai Liangpunsakul (Thailand) for technology for good, Ms Vivian Lim (Singapore) for gender equality, Mr The Huy Luong (Viet Nam) for social justice, Ms Emilie Palamy Pradichit (Thailand) for social justice, Ms Sherry Soon (Singapore) for invisible disability awareness, and Ms Catherine Sarah Young (Philippines) for the environment.</p><p>During the awarding ceremony, held virtually on 19 May 2022, Mr Ravindra Ngo, founder and chief executive officer of The Asian Network, welcomed and introduced the awardees. In his introductory speech, he emphasised that empathy and compassion to those who need them the most are important to tackle global challenges. He congratulated the awardees for their dedication, passion, and valuable work for community, society, and country.</p><p>In her opening remarks, Ms Antonella Noya, head of the Social Economy and Innovation Unit of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed thanks for the opportunity to send a good message on how and why it is possible to scale social impact of social enterprises on top of strengthening the social, economy, and policy ecosystem in different regions. She said she was counting on new generations to help address the challenges as met by OECD, which has demonstrated the importance of action to increase levels of social inclusion to provide jobs and promote digital transition. She noted that although Asia is the epicentre of global value chains, much of its population still lives below the poverty line and is excluded from the formal economy. She cited the need for increased awareness to achieve more resilient and inclusive growth. She said every actor in society and the economy has a role in promoting awareness and supporting the growth of business.</p><p>In her response, Ms Pradichit, founder and executive director of Manushya Foundation, shared her personal background as a political refugee since birth in the suburbs of France, and how she had witnessed inequalities and racial discrimination. She narrated how she used her personal story to focus on supporting marginalised communities and making local communities more visible and be at the centre of decision-making processes that concern them. She said she helps marginalised people know their rights, fight for social justice and equality, and amplify their voices. The Manushya Foundation is a women-led and innovative non-profit organisation promoting community empowerment to advance the human rights of marginalised communities and fight for social justice.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-family: sf_compact_textregular;">Ms Lim, co-founder of GEN, a non-profit organisation that works to close gender gaps, bridge generational differences, and find alternative voices to the general perspective, spoke of being passionate about building inclusive communities. She stated her belief in the need to understand cultural and gender diversities as one of the first steps to achieve progress in gender equity, especially in Asia. She cited the need to close gender gaps, bridge generational differences, and find alternative voices to the general perspective. She said understanding the unique gendered social structures is important to bridge the gaps and achieve gender equality.</span></p><p>Ms Young, a participatory artist whose work explores emerging technologies and alternative futures through interactive storytelling and sensory experiences, said she used her background in molecular biology, fine art, and interaction design to create interdisciplinary art projects about the environment. She specifically cited climate change as the focus of her work. She told her audience that the years ahead are years of repair of destruction by catastrophes that humans have created, such as fossil fuel emissions that lead to climate emergencies or habitat destruction causing diseases or rising inequality worldwide. She ended her response by stating that art and many disciplines play a part in planetary repair.</p><p>Dr Chua, founder of the Potter&rsquo;s Clay Education, suffered a stroke when he was 24 years old. Unable to practise medicine, he became an inspirational speaker, empowerment coach, and health ambassador. The foundation is a boutique tuition centre set up in 2009 to help students achieve their best. In his response, Dr Chua spoke of pushing boundaries and demonstrating strength in helping others, and helping people realise their strength and gift. He also spoke of how mindset is the core of what people do but is also the foundation upon which their potential is formed. Thus, he said, people can use their mindset to add value to the people they want to impact, with the ultimate desire to do what is best for society.</p><p><span style="font-family: sf_compact_textregular;">Dr Kinder, vice chair of the Women&rsquo;s Health Loddon Malee board, said in her response that she is an ardent advocate for rural and marginalised patients and their communities, and does clinical work in mental health. She said that geographic location continues to be a major predictor for the future of marginalised people and that, in Australia, those who live outside major cities continue to experience poorer health outcomes across almost every disease type. She now raises awareness, she said, about marginalised patients to ensure better support for them, whilst pointing out that geography should not predetermine one&rsquo;s destiny. The Women&rsquo;s Health Loddon Mallee is the regional women&rsquo;s health service for communities across regional North-West Victoria, Australia.</span></p><p>Mr Fayez is a policy officer who advocates for the national adoption and localisation of the United Nations 2250 resolution on youth, peace, and security. He promotes a culture of tolerance, openness, and respect. In his response, he noted how he had learned that the terms of peace and security are much more politicised in conflict-affected countries like Afghanistan. He observed that although people often relate peace with political agreement, looking at terms of peace and security from a new perspective, promoting new concepts related to everyday life, and adjusting to compromise with one another&rsquo;s response to emotions are steps to resolve disputes.</p><p>Diagnosed and living with vasculitis, Ms Soon, founder of Be Kind SG, said her experience of going through pain, suffering, and loss of opportunities made her realise what people with disabilities face, especially those with invisible disabilities. She said she used her experience to live a life that aims to create and inspire a kind and inclusive society for persons with special needs and those unable to find a stable job, or caregivers for people with special needs, through building relationships and empathy. Be Kind SG is a volunteer-led group whose mission is to create and inspire a kind and inclusive society for persons with invisible disabilities.</p><p>Mr Luong, co-founder of Äi Ä‘Æ°á»ng Nghe chuyá»‡n, is an openly gay jurist who works in the first non-governmental organisation working for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Viet Nam. He claimed that laws in several countries still prohibit LGBT rights and that although some countries are more advanced than others, what they are doing is still just a starting point in the LGBT movement. He said that to understand people, one must see how they treat people with less power. Similarly, he said, it is important to see how a society treats minority groups.</p><p>Ms Liangpunsakul, social impact director of Myanmar Innovation Lab, spoke of how technology brings joy and opportunity to young people, on top of enabling them to access global information. The Myanmar Innovation Lab, also known as Phandeeyar, is a technology seed accelerator that pioneers the use of technology to drive transformation and development. &nbsp;Her work, she said, involves spearheading the use of technology to accelerate change. She noted, however, that technology divides people at the same time. Nonetheless, she remarked, technology can be used to raise awareness and impact democracy. She said that although technology allows people to communicate more but connect less outside the digital world, technology should essentially be about awareness and connection in a community.</p><p>Closing the awarding ceremony, Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, director of strategy and partnership at ERIA, congratulated the awardees and expressed how interesting it was to listen to experiences from different countries&rsquo; leaders in various fields and disciplines. She said that each of the awardees carry an important reminder in their respective topics and fields, whilst also noting the importance of different approaches and initiatives for a sustainable and inclusive economic development of ASEAN and Asia in general. She cited inclusiveness and sustainability as the main field to which people should not lose focus upon, and that she hoped to grow a community that would work together for a more sustainable and inclusive community.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:83:"/uploads/news/20220519/2022_may_head-and-heart-award-ceremony_800x450_page-0001.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:19805:"Nine Youthful Leaders Receive 2022 Head and Heart Award Nine Youthful Leaders Receive 2022 Head and Heart Award Jakarta/Singapore, 19 May 2022:&nbsp;Nine outstanding individuals from various countries who have made major contributions to their communities and countries in the fields of health, gender, equality, and youth empowerment were the latest recipients of the Leaders by Head and Heart Award, an annual award given by The Asian Network in partnership with the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).
