Jakarta, 30 November 2020: The American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia (AmCham) and the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) hosted an event to launch the results of the survey &lsquo;The Impact of COVID-19 on Foreign Firms in ASEAN&rsquo;.
AmCham and ERIA created a rapid survey in April 2020 to understand the evolving needs of US companies in Indonesia. Five months later, the two institutions joined forces again to implement a similar survey providing a more in-depth investigation of how foreign companies in ASEAN have been responding to COVID-19 and what plans they have moving forward.
Twenty-four chambers and business organizations representing foreign companies were involved in the implementation of this survey. 264 firms with operations in ASEAN responded to 26 questions about the impact of COVID-19 on their business operations.
Key findings of the survey include:

Almost all firms experienced a negative impact due to the pandemic, with impacts on output, revenue, and/or sales across all countries of operation. Overall, the Dairy and Meat sector was hit the hardest with 100% reporting some degree of negative impact (&lsquo;slightly&rsquo;, &lsquo;moderately&rsquo; or &lsquo;significantly&rsquo; adverse). This is followed by Electronics and Healthcare. The Trade and Logistics sector is the least negatively impacted (50%) with 28% of firms experiencing some positive impact.
75% of firms experienced a significant reduction in output/revenue/sales. That reduction was due mostly to lack of demand (79%). 72% of firms experienced supply chain interruptions.
Measures taken in response to this included the introduction of remote working, hiring freezes, and reductions in the number of employees.
Up to 43% of firms already have or are considering reducing operations or production and up to 27% may reshore operations. Up to 48% may move operations from China to another country.
Most companies anticipate that business activities will stabilize in the &lsquo;new normal&rsquo; in Q2 2021 or later. 51% think it will be better in 2 years, 42% think it will be the same, 7 % think it will be worse.
Certain innovations such as increased video conferencing and working from home are expected to become permanent.

The event was opened by Mr Lin Neumann, the Managing Director of AmCham Indonesia.&nbsp; After welcoming the panellists and participants, he thanked ERIA for the strong collaboration.&nbsp; He also thanked the 24 businesses organizations and chambers representing many nationalities who helped to distribute the survey to their members.
In his Opening Remarks, Mr Koji Hachiyama, the COO of ERIA, thanked everyone who helped implement the survey and said &lsquo;This survey will serve as the voice of businesses across ASEAN regarding the impact of the pandemic on their operations and how they plan to manage operations and investment now and into the near future.&rsquo;&nbsp;
After showing a short video that summarized the results, Ms Lydia Ruddy, Director of Communications for ERIA who lead the survey, presented some of the results in more detail.&nbsp; This was followed by a panel discussion with Mr Sunit Dhoka, Country Representative, Cargill Indonesia; Ms Siobhan Das, CEO, American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce; and Mr Dionisius Narjoko, Senior Economist, ERIA.

According to Mr Hachiyama, ASEAN has contained the impact from COVID-19 and is expected to continue to have high growth after COVID-19. Businesses in ASEAN will also continue to grow dynamically while responding to the situation caused by COVID-19.</p><p>On digitalisation, he explained that ASEAN has a high potential for digitalisation as it is progressing rapidly. ASEAN will become a huge digital single market and will be a major player in the world economy in the future. On the other hand, there are still many problems, such as the security measures which are not catching up with rapid digitalisation. However, this situation will give many business opportunities as well. In ASEAN, digitalisation is in the rapid transition stage from &lsquo;Line activities&rsquo; (electronic commerce, etc.) to &lsquo;Area activities&rsquo; (data free flow and common data platform, digital transformation). Japanese technology could contribute positively to the digitalisation in ASEAN.</p><p>He also addressed the issue of the circular economy, which prioritises material recovery at the end of a product lifecycle to bring resources back into the production process and eliminate waste, such as in smart cities and recycling.

Dr Han started off with the key message that the ASEAN faces tremendous challenges in the race to carbon neutrality &lsquo;net zero emissions&rsquo; by the middle of the 21st century regarding the future energy landscape and how the energy transition will embrace a new architecture &ndash; including sound policies and technologies to ensure energy access together with affordability, energy security, and energy sustainability. Given the high share of fossil fuels in ASEAN&rsquo;s current energy mix (oil, coal, and natural gas comprise almost 80%), the clean use of fossil fuels through the deployment of clean technologies is indispensable for decarbonising ASEAN&rsquo;s emissions.</p><p>He also highlighted the fact that ASEAN is rich in solar resources, however only a few countries have offshore wind resources such as Viet Nam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Mainland Southeast Asia - &lsquo;the Mekong subregion&rsquo;- &nbsp;countries are rich of hydropower. Increasing the penetration of solar and wind could be facilitated by future power connectivity and trade within ASEAN. If the ASEAN electricity market gradually moves up to a multilateral/integrated electricity market, the hydropower resource from the Mekong subregion could play a significant role as the baseload power which can complement the high penetration of solar and wind energy. In the absence of a thermal power plant, a large capacity of electrical battery storage is necessary as power backup during days of less sunshine and wind. &nbsp;</p><p>The high penetration of variable renewable energy (solar and wind); the clean energy of hydrogen fuel; and carbon sink technology such as carbon capture sequestration utilisation and storage (CCUS) will become the future energy mix in massive scale, but only when the carbon price can be regulated. In the carbonisation scenarios of his presentation for ASEAN&rsquo;s case, the marginal abatement cost of decarbonisation could reach $700 US/tCO2 if the target of net zero emission is set at 2070. However, if the net zero emission target is set by 2050, the marginal abatement cost could skyrocket to $955US/tCO2.</p><p>Dr Phoumin also shared his view that such &nbsp;high-cost scenarios of decarbonisation may present challenges for the energy transition in ASEAN. However, CCUS is a promising technology in cost competitiveness for the foreseeable future. Managing the energy transition in ASEAN towards clean energy systems and carbon neutrality will need to consider the presence of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) in the short- and medium-term energy system. It will be crucial to explore ways to use fossil fuels in an environmentally sustainable manner to act as a bridge to a carbon-free energy future. For successful implementation of the energy transition and climate change policy objectives, policymakers will need to balance other equally important policy objectives of energy security, energy access, and affordability.</p><p>Further, ASEAN will need to set clear targets and actions in all sectors and programmes to facilitate the penetration of renewables, clean technologies, and clean energy to decarbonise ASEAN&rsquo;s emission. Appropriate financing instrument will need to be designed to support such up-take of clean technologies, clean fuels, and renewables. This presentation provided a roadmap of ASEAN&rsquo;s decarbonisation scenarios and gave attention to ASEAN&rsquo;s leaders, policy makers and stakeholders on how ASEAN will need to tackle emissions.</p><p>The race to carbon neutrality and net zero emissions of ASEAN will rely on today&rsquo;s actions, policies, and investments to change the fossil fuel-based energy system towards a cleaner energy system, but any decisions and energy policy measures to be rolled out during the energy transition need to be weighed against potentially higher energy costs, affordability issues, and energy security risks.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:112:"/uploads/news/20210524/2021_may_asean-japan-business-week-toward-innovative-and-sustainable-growth_1_800x450.png";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:20357:"ASEAN-Japan Business Week: Toward Innovative and Sustainable Growth ASEAN-Japan Business Week: Toward Innovative and Sustainable Growth Tokyo, 24 May 2021: Southeast Asia has always been at the heart of the international business for many Japanese companies, and it has become even more important for them to respond flexibly and rapidly to the massive transformations caused by transformations such as digitalisation and green growth in the region.

The opening session was divided into two sessions with different topics: first, Establishing New Partnerships between Japan and Southeast Asia, with the following speakers giving their remarks:

H. E. Kajiyama Hiroshi (Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Japan)
H.E. Dato Lim Jock Hoi (Secretary-General of ASEAN)

The speakers highlighted the importance of digitalisation, especially in the time of the pandemic. The digital transformation is rapidly accelerating in the ASEAN region. Therefore, taking advantage of this, Japan-ASEAN partnership can be strengthened to promote green growth.
Digitalisation and sustainability are critical to the recovery efforts in the next phase of economic integration. ASEAN has set a digital agenda through the ASEAN Digital Integration Framework Action Plan 2025. On sustainability and green growth, ASEAN has been continuously promoting financing of the ASEAN Green/Sustainability Bond Standards, as well as developing a roadmap for a sustainable capital market. These actions need support from all stakeholders in the region including the business community, as well as Japanese community.
ASEAN has also launched the Comprehensive Recovery Framework to promote programs and policies that will support a strong and resilient post-pandemic economy.&nbsp; JETRO JICA actively supports members companies of small-medium enterprises (SMEs) in a number of ways, including by providing the consultation desk. Promoting economic recovery and society 5.0 for sustainable development goals are also on the agenda.
There are three important elements to the ASEAN-Japan relationship: 1) strengthening ASEAN connectivity; 2) promoting the social development of digital technology; and 3) supporting sustainable growth (global agenda of climate change, environment, and decarbonisation).
The third session addressed Transforming Southeast Asia, Transforming Japanese Business.
During this session, the speakers emphasised the impact of COVID-19 across the region and the multiple challenges and opportunities that can develop as part of recovery including the circular economy and green growth. Digitalisation is developing very quickly, triggering the supply chain revolution. Most of the offline businesses are taking the advantages to expand their businesses to online platforms in order to survive (e-payment, telemedicine, fintech, agriculture, and fisheries). SMEs need support to adopt digital technology, otherwise, they are going to collapse. Digitalisation can also bring Japan to the Southeast Asia market.
Mr Koji Hachiyama, COO of ERIA, spoke on this panel. &nbsp;He opened his presentation by giving an overview of the ASEAN economic situation. According to Mr Hachiyama, ASEAN has contained the impact from COVID-19 and is expected to continue to have high growth after COVID-19.

He also addressed the issue of the circular economy, which prioritises material recovery at the end of a product lifecycle to bring resources back into the production process and eliminate waste, such as in smart cities and recycling. Mr Hachiyama highlighted six principles for advancing the circular economy in ASEAN:

Creating a concept under the international production network
Contributing to the promotion of ASEAN economic integration
Sufficiently assessing the impact on production costs and market prices, especially in SMEs
Raising awareness and recognizing that the circular economy will contribute to long-term growth
Promoting efforts that respect the ASEAN Way, such as coordination for the entire ASEAN
Ensuring financial sustainability and feasibility before proceeding with business

He said that with their advanced technologies, Japanese companies can become more involved and grow significantly together with ASEAN.
On the third day, ERIA Senior Energy Economist, Dr Han Phoumin, provided a keynote speech entitled &lsquo;Decarbonisation Scenarios for ASEAN: Methodology and Expected Results&rsquo; during the session on &lsquo;Promoting Green Business for Sustainable Development in Southeast Asia&rsquo;. Dr Han started off with the key message that the ASEAN faces tremendous challenges in the race to carbon neutrality &lsquo;net zero emissions&rsquo; by the middle of the 21st century regarding the future energy landscape and how the energy transition will embrace a new architecture &ndash; including sound policies and technologies to ensure energy access together with affordability, energy security, and energy sustainability. Given the high share of fossil fuels in ASEAN&rsquo;s current energy mix (oil, coal, and natural gas comprise almost 80%), the clean use of fossil fuels through the deployment of clean technologies is indispensable for decarbonising ASEAN&rsquo;s emissions.
He also highlighted the fact that ASEAN is rich in solar resources, however only a few countries have offshore wind resources such as Viet Nam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Mainland Southeast Asia - &lsquo;the Mekong subregion&rsquo;- &nbsp;countries are rich of hydropower. Increasing the penetration of solar and wind could be facilitated by future power connectivity and trade within ASEAN. If the ASEAN electricity market gradually moves up to a multilateral/integrated electricity market, the hydropower resource from the Mekong subregion could play a significant role as the baseload power which can complement the high penetration of solar and wind energy. In the absence of a thermal power plant, a large capacity of electrical battery storage is necessary as power backup during days of less sunshine and wind. &nbsp;
The high penetration of variable renewable energy (solar and wind); the clean energy of hydrogen fuel; and carbon sink technology such as carbon capture sequestration utilisation and storage (CCUS) will become the future energy mix in massive scale, but only when the carbon price can be regulated. In the carbonisation scenarios of his presentation for ASEAN&rsquo;s case, the marginal abatement cost of decarbonisation could reach $700 US/tCO2 if the target of net zero emission is set at 2070. However, if the net zero emission target is set by 2050, the marginal abatement cost could skyrocket to $955US/tCO2.
Dr Phoumin also shared his view that such &nbsp;high-cost scenarios of decarbonisation may present challenges for the energy transition in ASEAN. However, CCUS is a promising technology in cost competitiveness for the foreseeable future. Managing the energy transition in ASEAN towards clean energy systems and carbon neutrality will need to consider the presence of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) in the short- and medium-term energy system. It will be crucial to explore ways to use fossil fuels in an environmentally sustainable manner to act as a bridge to a carbon-free energy future. For successful implementation of the energy transition and climate change policy objectives, policymakers will need to balance other equally important policy objectives of energy security, energy access, and affordability.
Further, ASEAN will need to set clear targets and actions in all sectors and programmes to facilitate the penetration of renewables, clean technologies, and clean energy to decarbonise ASEAN&rsquo;s emission. Appropriate financing instrument will need to be designed to support such up-take of clean technologies, clean fuels, and renewables. This presentation provided a roadmap of ASEAN&rsquo;s decarbonisation scenarios and gave attention to ASEAN&rsquo;s leaders, policy makers and stakeholders on how ASEAN will need to tackle emissions.
The race to carbon neutrality and net zero emissions of ASEAN will rely on today&rsquo;s actions, policies, and investments to change the fossil fuel-based energy system towards a cleaner energy system, but any decisions and energy policy measures to be rolled out during the energy transition need to be weighed against potentially higher energy costs, affordability issues, and energy security risks.             2021-05-24 24 May 2021 1202 yaM 42 42-50-1202             .sksir ytiruces ygrene dna ,seussi ytilibadroffa ,stsoc ygrene rehgih yllaitnetop tsniaga dehgiew eb ot deen noitisnart ygrene eht gnirud tuo dellor eb ot serusaem ycilop ygrene dna snoisiced yna tub ,metsys ygrene renaelc a sdrawot metsys ygrene desab-leuf lissof eht egnahc ot stnemtsevni dna ,seicilop ,snoitca s;ouqsr&yadot no yler lliw NAESA fo snoissime orez ten dna ytilartuen nobrac ot ecar ehT

One of the five urgent tasks to do is to provide humanitarian assistance. In the current dry season, the fighting between the military junta and resistance forces including the ethnic armed organisations has intensified, causing increased human suffering. The number of affected people who have been displaced throughout the country at this juncture is around 700,000 as all conflicting parties continue to take advantage of the soon-to-end dry season.</p><p>For the time being, as part of the phase one approach focusing on saving lives, Asean has given US$700,000 (24 million baht) worth of medical supplies and equipment towards the Covid-19 response. In addition, Asean is expected to deliver another US$7 million of additional supplies to Myanmar during the first half of this year.</p><p>At the moment, the Asean Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Center) is working on the phase two approach to sustaining life, which will zero in on broader humanitarian needs inside Myanmar. Since this pivotal step is dealing with people in need, all activities and programmes must be non-discriminatory and independent.</p><p>When the Asean special envoy visited Myanmar in March, the military junta in Nay Pyi Taw agreed with his proposal to hold a consultative meeting on humanitarian assistance in Phnom Penh in the coming week.</p><div class="articl-content tbl-forkorts-article"><p>The one-day meeting will be attended by senior officials from all Asean members as well as other specialised UN agencies and civil society organisations. The purpose is to jump-start a multi-stakeholder dialogue to come up with recommendations to guide Asean's humanitarian assistance to Myanmar in the weeks and months to come.</p><p>The consultation will be divided into two sessions -- closed and open. The morning session is a closed one between the Asean members and Myanmar's Task Force on humanitarian assistance. The objective is to reach a common understanding and explore the possibility of improving the Asean framework such as the humanitarian corridor arrangement in Myanmar. This is a sensitive subject as all concerned parties lack mutual trust.</p><p>Furthermore, the meeting will also discuss various challenges on the ground that the Jakarta-based AHA Center will encounter during the efforts to provide the much-needed aid. One of the pressing issues that Asean must address is how to facilitate the administration of Covid-19 vaccines in Myanmar. The State Administration Council has already inoculated 42% of the population. The number could speedily increase if the situation is calmer with more cooperation from public health officials.</p><p>The second session is an open one. Both Asean and representatives from specialised UN agencies will exchange views and find practical ways to jointly collaborate with one another. The final session will be reserved for the dialogue partners. They will be updated with the latest progress and future plans to provide humanitarian assistance to Myanmar.

Despite setbacks due to the unsettled domestic conditions inside Myanmar since the coup in February 2021, Asean is moving ahead to explore practical ways to provide urgent humanitarian assistance to the affected peoples of Myanmar, the number of which will soon reach one million.
On May 6, the Asean special envoy to Myanmar, the Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Prak Sokhonn, is holding a high-level platform for Asean to kick off a multi-stakeholder dialogue and to find the best practical ways to provide the grouping's humanitarian assistance to Myanmar.
The meeting is part of the implementation of the five-point consensus agreed last April by Asean. One of the five urgent tasks to do is to provide humanitarian assistance. In the current dry season, the fighting between the military junta and resistance forces including the ethnic armed organisations has intensified, causing increased human suffering. The number of affected people who have been displaced throughout the country at this juncture is around 700,000 as all conflicting parties continue to take advantage of the soon-to-end dry season.
For the time being, as part of the phase one approach focusing on saving lives, Asean has given US$700,000 (24 million baht) worth of medical supplies and equipment towards the Covid-19 response. In addition, Asean is expected to deliver another US$7 million of additional supplies to Myanmar during the first half of this year.
At the moment, the Asean Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Center) is working on the phase two approach to sustaining life, which will zero in on broader humanitarian needs inside Myanmar. Since this pivotal step is dealing with people in need, all activities and programmes must be non-discriminatory and independent.
When the Asean special envoy visited Myanmar in March, the military junta in Nay Pyi Taw agreed with his proposal to hold a consultative meeting on humanitarian assistance in Phnom Penh in the coming week.

The one-day meeting will be attended by senior officials from all Asean members as well as other specialised UN agencies and civil society organisations. The purpose is to jump-start a multi-stakeholder dialogue to come up with recommendations to guide Asean's humanitarian assistance to Myanmar in the weeks and months to come.
The consultation will be divided into two sessions -- closed and open. The morning session is a closed one between the Asean members and Myanmar's Task Force on humanitarian assistance. The objective is to reach a common understanding and explore the possibility of improving the Asean framework such as the humanitarian corridor arrangement in Myanmar. This is a sensitive subject as all concerned parties lack mutual trust.
Furthermore, the meeting will also discuss various challenges on the ground that the Jakarta-based AHA Center will encounter during the efforts to provide the much-needed aid. One of the pressing issues that Asean must address is how to facilitate the administration of Covid-19 vaccines in Myanmar. The State Administration Council has already inoculated 42% of the population. The number could speedily increase if the situation is calmer with more cooperation from public health officials.
The second session is an open one. Both Asean and representatives from specialised UN agencies will exchange views and find practical ways to jointly collaborate with one another. The final session will be reserved for the dialogue partners. They will be updated with the latest progress and future plans to provide humanitarian assistance to Myanmar. Essentially, Asean is soliciting assistance from foreign partners.
Indeed, to speed up jabs for all communities in Myanmar, assistance from local and foreign partners is needed. Specialised UN agencies and international non-government organisations could work together with local authorities. Further negotiations are needed.
Lest we forgot, last October these issues were discussed at the multi-stakeholder meeting in Bangkok on the provision of humanitarian assistance for the people of Myanmar. It was the first attempt to garner support from the international community. Dozens of representatives from specialised UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Thai Red Cross, non-governmental organisations and civil society groups attended.
At the Phnom Penh meeting, Thailand, as Myanmar's eastern neighbour with a 2,401-kilometre common border, will have an important role to play as, because of its location, it will be serving as a hub for humanitarian assistance. Since the coup, the Thai authorities have been exploring possible cooperation with various partners and stakeholders to address the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar in a comprehensive manner. So far, the assistance has been confined to the border areas and to those who fled across to Thailand.
The Thai Red Cross Society remains the key local organisation, in cooperation with provincial public units, in providing humanitarian and medical aid to Myanmar's people. Currently, there are numerous challenges that all stakeholders have to address.
At the meeting in Nay Pyi Taw on March 23, Ko Ko Hlaing, Chief of the Task Force for Humanitarian Aid, told the Asean envoy and his team that all the assistance can only come through two routes -- Yangon's International Airport and the seaport. Other routes would not be allowed, especially along border areas with neighbouring countries. The SAC alleged that the land border has been used to smuggle arms.
The Asean chair hopes that the upcoming consultative meeting will come up with a comprehensive plan to provide humanitarian aid safely to all communities without any fear or favour. The hope is that with aid flowing, it will encourage all conflicting parties to enter political dialogue for fear of losing support if fighting were to cause more civilian casualties. Obviously, such dialogue is possible only if all sides agree, and could be held in Bangkok, the most convenient place for all parties.

<p><strong>Jakarta, 26 September 2022:</strong>&nbsp;The global community&rsquo;s transition into a post-pandemic world has been met with additional challenges resulting from climate change, ongoing supply chain disruptions, and international conflicts. At the centre of these problems are food security issues which have prompted policymakers to take swift and effective measures. Implementing the right policies that can answer this pressing issue has become crucial as basic food costs have risen by nearly 50% since the start of 2021. This imposes an additional burden on the world&rsquo;s poorest that are still reeling from the devastating impact of the pandemic where the UN estimates that approximately 118 million people have become chronically hungry since the start of the pandemic. Food security is directly linked to the agriculture and food sector which has been significantly affected during the pandemic. Trade and regional integration as well as trade and sustainable development are influential in ensuring food supply and food security.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s ASEAN on Point Public Forum Series covered the issue of food security in Southeast Asia. The event, hosted by the ASEAN Secretariat and the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia, sought to continue the conversation from the first ASEAN on Point discussion on sustainable food and agriculture which focused on agricultural productivity and sustainability. This latest forum centred on matters of trade, infrastructure, logistics, and the threat of food nationalism in addition to providing policy recommendations to facilitate the resiliency of ASEAN&rsquo;s agriculture and food sector in overcoming future crises.</p>
<p>Prof&nbsp;Paul Teng, Managing Director &amp; Dean, NIE International Pte. Ltd., Nanyang Technological University Singapore moderated the discussion between Dr Risti Permani, Senior Lecturer at the School of Agriculture and Food Sciences at the University of Queensland and Dr Ramon Clarete, Chief-of-Party B-SAFE Project, US Department of Agriculture.</p>

She also highlighted the emergence of problematic issues such as data biases and discrimination, which are affecting people around ASEAN, in particular women, refugees, and vulnerable communities.

The webinar was co-hosted and moderated by Mr TJ Ooi, Founder of Curated Connectors, a Singapore-based start-up. During the Q&amp;A session, moderated by Ms Lina Maulidina Sabrina, Programme Officer at ERIA, speakers discussed regional incubators practices, the usage of regulatory sandboxes and the challenges to provide more inclusive data collection.

With a better understanding of the virus and having over two years to adapt, Dr Menon believes that new virus variants will not derail the economic recovery. Although uncertainties remain, Dr Menon suggested that governments consider reopening borders given that complete border shutdowns have not stopped the significant rise of COVID-19 infections as seen in Singapore and Australia. Opening borders would counter rising protectionism and nationalism as well as reinstating the movement of workers which has significantly impacted global value chain operations. As such, regional and multilateral trade agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) &lsquo;must play a bigger role going forward.&rsquo;</p><p>Dr Narjoko credits the extraordinary investments by multinational corporations in Southeast and East Asia, since the 1980s, for helping the region&rsquo;s value chain to quickly recover during COVID-19. The severity and duration of the pandemic have, nonetheless, added immense pressure on companies to strive for efficiency as limitations on the movement of professionals led to higher logistics costs for industries. Dr Narjoko offered three recommendations to ease the burden, namely: (1) Aim for faster digital adoption; (2) Streamline the supply process by upgrading technologies; (3) Enhance human capital and skills transformation to cope with more high-tech machines. The implementation of the RCEP will be especially crucial to facilitate a post-pandemic recovery as it is intended to make trade faster and cheaper hence supporting higher growth of value chains.</p><p>Dr Bhaopichitr shared her assessment on the macroeconomic and non-macroeconomic trends set to impact ASEAN, adding that &lsquo;the world is recovering, but recovery is divergent where developed countries are growing much faster during this period.&rsquo; AMS can expect the US to raise its interest rates and see a stronger US Dollar which will have serious effects on public sector debts. ASEAN can also expect more relocations of factories to the region as the US &ndash; China trade and tech wars heat up. On future opportunities, Dr Bhaopichitr finds that digitalisation will remain a mainstay in ASEAN&rsquo;s economic growth story and that the region ought to take advantage of the abundance of its raw materials to deepen decarbonisation efforts.</p><p>The QnA session concentrated on maximising digitalisation potential in which all three panellists underscored the issue of labour market disruptions in key sectors like property and finance.

The focus of our intervention should be on segments of society that are most vulnerable to the pandemic such as women, youth, medium and small enterprises, and tourism players.

Hopefully, this will enhance the utilisation of our +1 FTA and other FTAs.</p><p><strong>Q: What are the next steps for ASEAN regarding the implementation of the RCEP?</strong></p><p>A: We must first dispel that the RCEP is China-led because, from the start, it has always been ASEAN-led.

We&rsquo;re working closely with AMS and non-ASEAN RCEP countries to expedite their respective domestic procedures. China has ratified it and Japan is on board, and hopefully so will New Zealand. We are also conducting outreach on the technical requirements of the RCEP agreement in which the ASEAN Secretariat will work in-depth with the East Asia Business Council. We are working closely to start our RCEP Secretariat which will be the main engine of this agreement.</p><p><strong>Q: When can the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) be operationalised in the context of the broader geopolitical situation?</strong></p><p>A: We have increased our utility of the AOIP as a framework for cooperation between ASEAN and its partners. I think ASEAN can pursue a discussion on how to mainstream or operationalise these key priority areas. Another aspect is connectivity which is integral to securing regional peace and security. With initiatives such as the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, we need to assess whether there is synergy or convergence to enhance connectivity. The other element of AOIP is sustainable development which we can work closely with the UN on the sustainable development agenda. There are so many economic activities in the Indo-Pacific and I think we can work out and agree among ourselves to develop areas of cooperation and this can be done to other ASEAN-led mechanisms like ASEAN + 1.</p><p><strong>Q: What role can ASEAN play to maintain stability in the region during the US &ndash; China competition?</strong></p><p>A: We want to see this region maintain peace and stability. Both the US and China are ASEAN&rsquo;s major trading partners and we recognise that they contribute substantively to the region&rsquo;s economic growth and development. We want to see peaceful, good relations between the US and China.</p><p>ASEAN provides a platform for dialogue between countries like the US and China. ASEAN-led mechanisms like the ASEAN Regional Forum and East Asia Summit provide the US and China platforms for interactions. The US and China continue to support ASEAN centrality and for ASEAN to continue being a driving force in the region. We hope that the manifestation of such support will be pursued substantively and enhanced in the future.</p><p><strong>Q: What are the next steps to the agreed &lsquo;Five-Point Consensus&rsquo;?</strong></p><p>A: There is an ASEAN special envoy who can assist with the work to bridge the gap that is happening in Myanmar. We want to see Myanmar be stable as they are part of ASEAN, and an unstable Myanmar will have implications on ASEAN as well. We must not politicise ASEAN&rsquo;s humanitarian system in Myanmar to ensure that support effectively reaches communities in need and is expedited without impediments.</p><p>A peaceful resolution in Myanmar rests on its people. We can help them, and it will not happen overnight. ASEAN stands ready to assist Myanmar on the path to such solutions through facilitating constructive dialogues, and we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance.</p><p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/X3fkYRWlQBE" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p>Mr Koji Hachiyama, COO of ERIA, closed the ERT by thanking all the participants, in particular, editors and journalists who are at the frontline of information sharing. &lsquo;You are the best informers of our common efforts to fight back against the pandemic,&rsquo; he stated.

Dr Aladdin D Rillo, Senior Economic Advisor, ERIA

Ms Ima Abdulrahim, Director of Public Policy Southeast Asia, Facebook

Ms Robinson opened the panel by highlighting the myriad issues ASEAN must address to ensure that ASEAN is prepared for the &lsquo;new dynamics&rsquo; ranging from a falling labour force participation, value chain slowdowns, and growing inequalities. Coupled with significant forces like climate change, digitalisation, and a green economy, she asked panellists to explore whether the region is prepared to overcome the multitude of new dynamics headed its way.

&nbsp;
The last session featured a Special Dialogue with Secretary-General HE Dato Paduka Lim Jock Hoi together with Prof Nishimura who posed the questions.
Q: What are the major challenges for ASEAN to recover quickly from the COVID-19 damage?
A: We need to be mindful that uneven recovery in various sectors and societies if left unaddressed, may result in growing inequality in terms of income and access to digital technology for Southeast Asia. The focus of our intervention should be on segments of society that are most vulnerable to the pandemic such as women, youth, medium and small enterprises, and tourism players. Regionally, we have finalised The Post-COVID-19 Recovery Plan for ASEAN Tourism and expedited the implementation of the ASEAN Travel Corridor Arrangement Framework. We need to speed up the recovery process in travel and tourism which contribute nearly US$380 billion to the economies of AMS. &nbsp;
Q: What are the next steps pertaining to the ASEAN Single Window (ASW) integration in the context of digital ASEAN?
The ASW is already in operation, and we are the only region that has this arrangement. With three document exchanges in 2022, ASEAN will be in the position as one of the most advanced regions transforming paperless trading. This would add more confidence in the region as we aim to double our intra-trading activities in terms of volume. ASEAN is working to expand the ASW to ASEAN +1 free trade agreements (FTA) and with dialogue partners. Hopefully, this will enhance the utilisation of our +1 FTA and other FTAs.
Q: What are the next steps for ASEAN regarding the implementation of the RCEP?
A: We must first dispel that the RCEP is China-led because, from the start, it has always been ASEAN-led. We must make sure that the implementation can be achieved this year and entered into force in January 2022, and by the look of it, ASEAN will achieve this. We&rsquo;re working closely with AMS and non-ASEAN RCEP countries to expedite their respective domestic procedures. China has ratified it and Japan is on board, and hopefully so will New Zealand. We are also conducting outreach on the technical requirements of the RCEP agreement in which the ASEAN Secretariat will work in-depth with the East Asia Business Council. We are working closely to start our RCEP Secretariat which will be the main engine of this agreement.
Q: When can the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) be operationalised in the context of the broader geopolitical situation?
A: We have increased our utility of the AOIP as a framework for cooperation between ASEAN and its partners. I think ASEAN can pursue a discussion on how to mainstream or operationalise these key priority areas. Another aspect is connectivity which is integral to securing regional peace and security. With initiatives such as the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, we need to assess whether there is synergy or convergence to enhance connectivity. The other element of AOIP is sustainable development which we can work closely with the UN on the sustainable development agenda. There are so many economic activities in the Indo-Pacific and I think we can work out and agree among ourselves to develop areas of cooperation and this can be done to other ASEAN-led mechanisms like ASEAN + 1.
Q: What role can ASEAN play to maintain stability in the region during the US &ndash; China competition?
A: We want to see this region maintain peace and stability. Both the US and China are ASEAN&rsquo;s major trading partners and we recognise that they contribute substantively to the region&rsquo;s economic growth and development. We want to see peaceful, good relations between the US and China.
ASEAN provides a platform for dialogue between countries like the US and China. ASEAN-led mechanisms like the ASEAN Regional Forum and East Asia Summit provide the US and China platforms for interactions. The US and China continue to support ASEAN centrality and for ASEAN to continue being a driving force in the region. We hope that the manifestation of such support will be pursued substantively and enhanced in the future.
Q: What are the next steps to the agreed &lsquo;Five-Point Consensus&rsquo;?
A: There is an ASEAN special envoy who can assist with the work to bridge the gap that is happening in Myanmar. We want to see Myanmar be stable as they are part of ASEAN, and an unstable Myanmar will have implications on ASEAN as well. We must not politicise ASEAN&rsquo;s humanitarian system in Myanmar to ensure that support effectively reaches communities in need and is expedited without impediments.
A peaceful resolution in Myanmar rests on its people. We can help them, and it will not happen overnight. ASEAN stands ready to assist Myanmar on the path to such solutions through facilitating constructive dialogues, and we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance.

Mr Koji Hachiyama, COO of ERIA, closed the ERT by thanking all the participants, in particular, editors and journalists who are at the frontline of information sharing. &lsquo;You are the best informers of our common efforts to fight back against the pandemic,&rsquo; he stated. He further expressed hopes that next year we could meet in Cambodia in person.             2021-10-08 8 October 2021 1202 rebotcO 8 80-01-1202             .nosrep ni aidobmaC ni teem dluoc ew raey txen taht sepoh desserpxe rehtruf eH .detats eh ;ouqsr&,cimednap eht tsniaga kcab thgif ot stroffe nommoc ruo fo sremrofni tseb eht era uoY;ouqsl& .gnirahs noitamrofni fo eniltnorf eht ta era ohw stsilanruoj dna srotide ,ralucitrap ni ,stnapicitrap eht lla gniknaht yb TRE eht desolc ,AIRE fo OOC ,amayihcaH ijoK rM

Particularly in trade, it is playing a key role in changing modern human life and leading changes in what and how people trade. But whilst digital transformation improves productivity and trade, it also raises inequality through displacement effects and impacts on developing countries through premature deindustrialisation and disappearance of manual and routine.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Such observations were shared by Dr Lili Yan Ing, lead advisor on Southeast Asia of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), in a webinar titled Digital Transformation in Trade held on 8 June 2022. The webinar was one of the side events of the Road to Group of Twenty (G20) and conducted by the Ministry of Trade of Indonesia with ERIA and the International Trade Analysis and Policy Studies.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Citing privacy, cyber security, competition, and digital divide issues as the key challenges in digital transformation and digital trade faced by countries, particularly the G20 countries, Dr Ing suggested to the G20 four main points to achieve digital transformation development for all. First, it is important for the G20 to implement what has been committed in digital transformation and digital trade, including the frameworks. Second, G20 needs to commit to improve the quality of digital enablers, from physical to human capital. Third, G20 should promote efforts to improve the preparedness for digital adoption to reduce digital divides between and within countries. Finally, she said, it is important to have privacy and competition laws be implemented worldwide. In the question and answer session, Dr Ing cited the importance for governments to provide estimations and an outlook for the economy and communicate them well to small and medium-sized enterprises. The economic outlook and credible forecast, she said, could help them anticipate ongoing development issues as well as upcoming economic disturbances.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Other speakers in the webinar were Albert Park, chief economist of the Asian Development Bank; Haroon Bhorat, professor of economics and director of the Development Policy Research Unit of the University of Cape Town; Torbjörn Fredriksson, head of the E-commerce and Digital Economy Branch of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development; Leonard Theosabrata, director of the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of Indonesia; Zahra Murad, head of UKM Center FEB UI; Pamitra Wineka, chief executive officer (CEO) of TaniHub; and Edward Tirtanata, CEO of Kopi Kenangan.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:85:"/uploads/news/2022_june_ensuring-digital-transformation-development-for-all-5-800.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:451:"                                                                                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfit7Qo77uY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>                                                                                                ";s:4:"tags";N;s:6:"editor";s:12:"Lili Yan Ing";s:6:"author";N;s:6:"doc_no";N;s:6:"period";N;s:14:"article_status";N;s:10:"event_time";N;s:5:"venue";N;s:5:"major";N;s:16:"article_keywords";N;s:9:"organizer";N;s:12:"image_name_2";N;s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";N;s:9:"published";s:1:"1";s:9:"highlight";s:1:"0";s:8:"order_id";s:3:"100";s:12:"created_date";N;s:13:"modified_date";s:19:"2022-08-12 21:02:43";s:11:"modified_by";s:1:"1";s:7:"old_url";N;s:10:"majorEmail";N;s:9:"education";N;s:10:"experience";N;s:12:"publications";N;s:6:"others";N;s:13:"presentations";N;s:7:"feature";N;s:11:"sub_experts";s:1:"7";s:15:"sub_dep_experts";N;s:13:"meta_keywords";s:51:"Ensuring Digital Transformation Development for All";s:16:"meta_description";s:51:"Ensuring Digital Transformation Development for All";s:5:"sc_id";s:1:"0";}i:14;O:8:"stdClass":46:{s:9:"short_des";N;s:10:"article_id";s:4:"7369";s:12:"article_type";s:10:"multimedia";s:3:"uri";s:105:"Entrepreneurship_in_the_Environmental_Field:_Insights_from_Women-led_Businesses_on_Tackling_Plastic_Waste";s:8:"pub_type";s:1:"0";s:5:"title";s:105:"Entrepreneurship in the Environmental Field: Insights from Women-led Businesses on Tackling Plastic Waste";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2022-11-03";s:11:"posted_year";s:1:"0";s:12:"posted_month";s:1:"0";s:7:"content";s:9326:"<!DOCTYPE html>

<p><strong>Jakarta, 3 November 2022:</strong>&nbsp;The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) through a collaboration between the Entrepreneurship, Startups, and Innovation&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esi-eria.org/">(E-S-I) Knowledge Lab</a>&nbsp;and the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris&nbsp;<a href="https://rkcmpd-eria.org/">(RKC-MPD)</a>&nbsp;hosted a webinar on 3 November 2022, titled 'Female Entrepreneurs in the ASEAN Region: Innovation to Tackle Marine Plastic Waste'. This webinar aimed to raise awareness about the alarming marine plastic pollution and highlight the innovative efforts taken by the private sector in addressing the issue.</p>
<p>The webinar invited three female entrepreneurs addressing plastic waste issues in the region&mdash;Ms Ovy Sabrina&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://rebricks.id/">Rebricks Indonesia</a>,&nbsp;Dr Supatchaya Techachoochert&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.refillstationbkk.com/">Refill Station</a>&nbsp;in Thailand, and&nbsp;Ms Juliana Adam&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biji-biji.com/">Biji-biji Initiative</a>&nbsp;in Malaysia&mdash;who shared their respective stories, including challenges and lessons learned that came along their journey as sustainability entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The three women admitted that their forays into sustainable business were somewhat accidental, but the goal was similar: Promoting zero waste lifestyle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Me and my partner, Novita, were beginning to practice the lifestyle when we realised there are certain types of plastic waste that we cannot recycle,&rsquo; said Ms Sabrina, referring to her business partner, Rebrick CEO, Novita Tan.</p>
<p>Not wanting to 'pass down' non-recyclable plastic waste to their children&rsquo;s generation, both came up with an idea to recycle plastic waste into building materials and founded Rebricks Indonesia.</p>
<p>As for Ms Adam, it was the endeavour to generate alternative incomes for underserved community members in Malaysia that led her way to become an entrepreneur. Together with her team, she is working to improve the livelihood of others while also championing environmental sustainability through her waste recycling and management company, Biji-biji Initiative.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr Techachoochert&rsquo;s interest in the business grew when living alternately between the forest and the city for her doctoral research in Biology.&nbsp; As she observed how most environmental problems are rooted in urban lifestyle, she decided to open Refill Station to raise public awareness of plastic waste. Today, that first bulk store in Thailand she co-founded with her friends is more than just a business.</p>
<p>'Having a store is a kind of communication channel, so I have more room to express my interest, talk about the problem, and I can point out what other alternatives that people can do to help,' Ms Techachoochert explained.</p>
<p><strong>Changing Consumer Behaviour: Between Incentives and Facilities</strong></p>
<p>In the efforts to encourage recycling behaviour, the ability to compromise is important for entrepreneurs to have. Dr Techachoochert learned that taking a hard-liner approach will lose people&rsquo;s adherence. She believes that by being a leader who is adaptive and able to compromise, one can set an example that could encourage people to follow.</p>
<p>Ms Adam observed how in Malaysia, giving incentives to make people segregate and recycle their waste seems to work to build the habit of recycling among underserved community members. However, the same approach did not work as well for urban areas, she said.</p>
<p>The situation is similar with Indonesia. According to Ms Sabrina, incentives only worked for the area where such income had a meaningful impact. &lsquo;Urban communities, especially middle-class citizens, do not care about the incentives; they would take action only when a formal system is in place,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Dr Techachoochert said that infrastructure should be in place to support people in segregating and recycling waste. She shared a story about a family member who used to segregate waste when living in Japan but stopped the practice once she moved back to Thailand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because there are no facilities to build trust. It is contradictory when we tell people to segregate waste at home, but the government only provides one bin to dump every waste into. There is no clear visibility that the mixed waste will be segregated and recycled at the end,&rsquo; she explained.</p>
<p><strong>Private Sector and Government Need to Move at the Same Pace</strong></p>
<p>The private sector in Thailand, according to Ms Techachoochert, is generally quite aware of and enthusiastic about addressing plastic pollution. However, despite the recent good news about the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) implementation, she thought the government is still relatively slow in responding to this issue.</p>
<p>'The private sector is getting ready, but laws and policies are holding them back from moving forward,' she said.</p>
<p>Ms Adam, however, believes private sector could elevate the environmental debate by simply adopting green practices without having to wait for policies to precede. &lsquo;Sure, policies should be put in place, but I strongly believe that each individual and organisation, each business, must take the initiatives on their own,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>She added that business owners can start small by evaluating their operational practices, switching plastic packaging to more sustainable alternatives, and forming partnerships with other stakeholders to ensure material circularity.</p>
<p>In terms of sustaining their business, Ms Sabrina believes social entrepreneurs need to balance their idealism and their adaptability. &lsquo;At the end of the day, as an entrepreneur, you need to sell. Otherwise, you cannot sustain your company. You need to create revenue, otherwise, you cannot create more impact,&rsquo; she said, adding that having the right business partner enables her to balance these two important sides.</p>
<p><strong>Various Government Supports to Accelerate Impactful Businesses</strong></p>
<p>When asked about other supports needed from the government, Dr Techachoochert said the government should be able to respond to the rapid changes quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They used to give classification codes for products that come with containers but did not provide any codes for refilling products that come without containers. Despite this, we didn&rsquo;t give in, we kept pushing on. And then the government approached us to gain some insights from our business, and only later did they launch relevant policies after the shop had been already operational,' she said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ms Techachoochert hopes that the government could help promote the businesses and educate the public about the problem they are trying to solve through various communication channels under the authority.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, Ms Adam said a policy aiming to enable multistakeholder partnerships has been in place. This policy fosters collaborations between big corporations, non-governmental organisations, and social enterprises to create a collective impact.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For example, recognising the impact that the third sector can create, and then ensuring support from the bigger players. Although the policy is in place, the execution is another story. But I feel like it is a good first step towards it,&rsquo; she explained.</p>
<p>Ms Adam highlighted another big challenge: the lack of local recycling infrastructure. She said she hoped logistic support to set up the necessary infrastructure, especially from the government, could come into place.</p>
<p>Ms Sabrina, meanwhile, urged the government to allow SMEs like her own to be the supplier for government projects.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our team has worked hard to create reliable products at a competitive price, and despite having ample supply of non-recyclable plastic waste to create eco-friendly construction material, the demand for our products is not up to par. We believe the opportunity to be a government supplier will significantly leverage our business and the impact we could create.&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Mr Michikazu Kojima, Senior Advisor to the President on Environmental Issues at ERIA who also leads the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris, reiterated the important roles played by the private sector to lead the way for a more circular economy for plastics.</p>
<p>'I believe we can all agree that the private sector plays an instrumental role in our collective efforts to put a break on the current trend of plastic pollution. With its economic leverage, the private sector has the potential to nudge the conventional and linear way of plastic consumption and production towards a more circular one,' said Mr Kojima.</p>
<p>Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, the Director of Strategy and Partnerships of ERIA, said entrepreneurs and business models can really offer very important solutions for this pressing global challenge. &lsquo;Therefore, it is very important also for policymakers to hear from entrepreneurs and innovators,' Dr Marsan said.</p>

The event was jointly organized by AustCham ASEAN and ERIA, through its Strategy and Partnership programme, funded by Australia. The webinar attracted more than 100 participants.</p><p>Mr Koji Hachiyama opened the webinar with welcome remarks and the Australian Ambassador to ASEAN, Will Nankervis, delivered the keynote speech. Other speakers included Ms Chau Ta, President of AustCham ASEAN, Dr John Ackermann, Founding Director of PT Mitra Asia Lestari and Dr Intan Ramli, Policy Fellow at ERIA. Ms Jodi Weedon, Executive Director AustCham ASEAN and Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, ERIA Strategy and Partnership Director moderated the event.</p><p>In his welcoming remarks, Mr Koji Hachiyama highlighted the importance of building resilient supply chains across ASEAN and East Asia and thanked Ambassador Nankervis, the Australian Mission to ASEAN and AustCham ASEAN for the organization of the joint event. He also mentioned how the AustCham survey complements and brings additional points of view to two surveys ERIA is currently conducting: one with the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia to survey foreign firms across ASEAN and the other survey focussed on Japanese firms in ASEAN.</p><p>Ambassador Nankervis mentioned the importance of ASEAN to Australia and the important role that Australian businesses have to play during the post-pandemic economic recovery. He also highlighted the importance of further regional economic integration and of the multi-lateral trading system, of which the forthcoming RCEP agreement is an important regional pillar. Ambassador Nankervis thanked AustCham ASEAN and ERIA for hosting the webinar and interacted with the audience during the Q&amp;A session at the end.</p><p>President Chau Ta gave a presentation on the main findings of the latest AustCham ASEAN business survey. The survey found that COVID-19 will have a negative impact on business in the next 6 months, but that sentiment has improved since April. At the same time, almost half of the respondents do not anticipate that the economic slow-down caused by the pandemic would be bad for their business. Interestingly, 71% of respondents agreed that business opportunities have emerged from COVID-19.</p><p>Dr John Ackermann provided a perspective from the business sector, specifically from the agricultural sector in Indonesia. He mentioned the several issues brought by the pandemic to the sector, such as logistic and transportation issues, commodity price fluctuation, change in consumer habits, etc. At the same time, the current situation also brings opportunities to adopt quickly digital technologies and embrace innovation. He presented the TraNSIT project, supported by the Australian Government, a computer-based tool that maps all agriculture freight from origin to destination by modelling transport route and costs and described how it works in Indonesia.</p><p>Dr Intan Ramli gave a presentation on the importance of good regulatory practices in mitigating the impacts of the pandemic in ASEAN.

The event was jointly organized by AustCham ASEAN and ERIA, through its Strategy and Partnership programme, funded by Australia. The webinar attracted more than 100 participants.
Mr Koji Hachiyama opened the webinar with welcome remarks and the Australian Ambassador to ASEAN, Will Nankervis, delivered the keynote speech. Other speakers included Ms Chau Ta, President of AustCham ASEAN, Dr John Ackermann, Founding Director of PT Mitra Asia Lestari and Dr Intan Ramli, Policy Fellow at ERIA. Ms Jodi Weedon, Executive Director AustCham ASEAN and Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, ERIA Strategy and Partnership Director moderated the event.
In his welcoming remarks, Mr Koji Hachiyama highlighted the importance of building resilient supply chains across ASEAN and East Asia and thanked Ambassador Nankervis, the Australian Mission to ASEAN and AustCham ASEAN for the organization of the joint event. He also mentioned how the AustCham survey complements and brings additional points of view to two surveys ERIA is currently conducting: one with the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia to survey foreign firms across ASEAN and the other survey focussed on Japanese firms in ASEAN.
Ambassador Nankervis mentioned the importance of ASEAN to Australia and the important role that Australian businesses have to play during the post-pandemic economic recovery. He also highlighted the importance of further regional economic integration and of the multi-lateral trading system, of which the forthcoming RCEP agreement is an important regional pillar. Ambassador Nankervis thanked AustCham ASEAN and ERIA for hosting the webinar and interacted with the audience during the Q&amp;A session at the end.
President Chau Ta gave a presentation on the main findings of the latest AustCham ASEAN business survey. The survey found that COVID-19 will have a negative impact on business in the next 6 months, but that sentiment has improved since April. At the same time, almost half of the respondents do not anticipate that the economic slow-down caused by the pandemic would be bad for their business. Interestingly, 71% of respondents agreed that business opportunities have emerged from COVID-19.
Dr John Ackermann provided a perspective from the business sector, specifically from the agricultural sector in Indonesia. He mentioned the several issues brought by the pandemic to the sector, such as logistic and transportation issues, commodity price fluctuation, change in consumer habits, etc. At the same time, the current situation also brings opportunities to adopt quickly digital technologies and embrace innovation. He presented the TraNSIT project, supported by the Australian Government, a computer-based tool that maps all agriculture freight from origin to destination by modelling transport route and costs and described how it works in Indonesia.
Dr Intan Ramli gave a presentation on the importance of good regulatory practices in mitigating the impacts of the pandemic in ASEAN. She highlighted the need to promote sharing of information and best practices in handling the pandemic, business consultation support, and public-private sector collaboration efforts; the importance of enhancing partnerships/collaborations between the government and the private sector; and of building on existing trade facilitating platforms in ASEAN. She also mentioned how the use and adoption of science, technology and innovation, and digital economy provide an opportunity and need to be encouraged, for instance by continuing the implementation of the ASEAN Work Program on Electronic-Commerce.             2020-09-21 21 September 2020 0202 rebmetpeS 12 12-90-0202             .ecremmoC-cinortcelE no margorP kroW NAESA eht fo noitatnemelpmi eht gniunitnoc yb ecnatsni rof ,degaruocne eb ot deen dna ytinutroppo na edivorp ymonoce latigid dna ,noitavonni dna ygolonhcet ,ecneics fo noitpoda dna esu eht woh denoitnem osla ehS .NAESA ni smroftalp gnitatilicaf edart gnitsixe no gnidliub fo dna ;rotces etavirp eht dna tnemnrevog eht neewteb snoitaroballoc/spihsrentrap gnicnahne fo ecnatropmi eht ;stroffe noitaroballoc rotces etavirp-cilbup dna ,troppus noitatlusnoc ssenisub ,cimednap eht gnildnah ni secitcarp tseb dna noitamrofni fo gnirahs etomorp ot deen eht dethgilhgih ehS .NAESA ni cimednap eht fo stcapmi eht gnitagitim ni secitcarp yrotaluger doog fo ecnatropmi eht no noitatneserp a evag ilmaR natnI rD

However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the socio-economic landscape. Amid a global context of recovery from the pandemic, countries, industries and firms are faced with the intensification of two core transformational trends to society: on the one hand, the increased adoption of digital technologies can be key to boosting aggregate productivity and raising the skills of actors that were previously lagging behind. On the other, it has become clear that innovation and systemic change will be crucial in confronting the challenge of climate change and achieving carbon neutrality for sustainable long-term economic growth. Governments can play a decisive role in designing industry, innovation, and entrepreneurship policy mixes that allow firms to better navigate and thrive during these transitions.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 14px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.3px;">The region needs to implement measures to realise its vision towards a more inclusive and sustainable ASEAN in the post-pandemic phase. Key areas to support the transition are a faster adoption of digital technologies, training, reskilling and upskilling of individuals, and the implementation of environmental protection frameworks, such as the '<a href="https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Brochure-Circular-Economy-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: rgb(36, 36, 36); text-decoration-line: underline;">Framework for the Circular Economy</a> for the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC)'. In addition, the social economy approach represents a cutting-edge solution to build back better and more resilient. This approach implies injecting more social responsibility into the economic sphere: the promotion of more inclusive and social business models is crucial, as well as the development of right skills to foster cooperation between social economy enterprises and inclusive business, including through partnerships.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 14px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.3px;">ERIA partnered with the OECD to contribute to two side events of the OECD Southeast Asia Regional Programme (SEARP) Ministerial Conference taking place in Seoul, Korea on 9-10 February 2022.

The annual meeting brings together members of ERIA&rsquo;s AAC which is made up of internationally renowned East Asia Summit countries' scholars and experts from universities, research institutions, the private sector, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations.
Chairperson of AAC, Dr Hank Lim (Senior Research Fellow, Singapore Institute of International Affairs), moderated the virtual meeting. The AAC members in attendance were Prof Dr Peter Drysdale (Emeritus Professor, Crawford School of Economics and Government, Australia), Prof Gary Hawke (Emeritus Professor, Victoria University of Wellington, and Senior Fellow, NZ Institute of Economic Research, New Zealand), Prof Zhang Yuyan (Director, Institute of World Economics and Politics (IWEP), Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS)), and Mr Pravin Kumar Agarwal (Director of The Energy and Resource Institute, India). Dr Hiroshi Sato (Director General of ERIA Support Office, IDE-JETRO) attended as the proxy representing Prof Kyoji Fukao, President of the Institute of Developing Economies (IDE) JETRO, Japan.
In his opening remarks, Dr Hank Lim welcomed all the AAC members and participants who joined from various parts of the world, an undertaking he highlighted was possible due to technological advancements. He further noted that the pandemic is not a transitory period thus ERIA must be prepared to understand the implications of the COVID-19 crisis on regional and global development.
Prof Hidetoshi Nishimura, President of ERIA, called attention to the weak global economic forecast of negative 4.9% this year then asserted the importance to sustain active international production networks and to enhance international competitiveness. In the context of research activities in FY2019, Prof Nishimura mentioned ERIA&rsquo;s extensive work and policy papers on regional production networks, energy supply and demand estimation, and waste management in wake of the pandemic.
Prof Nishimura invited AAC members to take advantage of the event to address four central themes listed in the Ministers Joint Media Statement from the EAS Economic Ministers Meeting in August where ERIA presented. &nbsp;The themes are: 1) Improve trade and investment including making value chains resilient to shocks of EAS economies, 2) Effectively address the impending recession, 3) Promote new technologies and 4) Develop a framework for the EAS regional economic integration and development after overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic&rdquo;.
ERIA&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer Mr Koji Hachiyama provided a general overview on the direction of ERIA Work Plan for FY2020 and Beyond, marking Mr Hachiyama&rsquo;s first AAC participating since his appointment in June 2019. AAC members were given a first glimpse of ERIA&rsquo;s new office at the ASEAN Secretariat building which opened in July 2020, and Mr Hachiyama expressed his hope that it will become a new hub for the think tank&rsquo;s future activities.
Prof Fukunari Kimura, ERIA&rsquo;s Chief Economist, showcased the organization's research activities in FY2019 and FY2020 followed by a presentation from Prof Jun Arima, ERIA&rsquo;s Senior Policy Fellow for Energy and Environment regarding energy research activities for FY2019 and FY2020.
The event participants as well as AAC members praised ERIA&rsquo;s ability to rise above the challenges triggered by the pandemic such as by continuing its many research activities. Prof Gary Hawke stated that the success is testimony to ERIA&rsquo;s numerous achievements accumulated over the years. The important and wide-ranging research that ERIA has conducted gives it an upper hand in assisting decisionmakers with policy redirections or responses during these unprecedented times.
In his closing speech, Prof Nishimura expressed his appreciation for the interactive and fruitful implementation of the 12th Academic Advisory Council Meeting. Going forward and in the post-pandemic world, ERIA will continue promoting regional economic integration and sustainable economic development in the East Asia region through multi-faceted research in diverse sectors.             2020-09-12 12 September 2020 0202 rebmetpeS 21 21-90-0202             .srotces esrevid ni hcraeser detecaf-itlum hguorht noiger aisA tsaE eht ni tnempoleved cimonoce elbaniatsus dna noitargetni cimonoce lanoiger gnitomorp eunitnoc lliw AIRE ,dlrow cimednap-tsop eht ni dna drawrof gnioG .gniteeM licnuoC yrosivdA cimedacA ht21 eht fo noitatnemelpmi luftiurf dna evitcaretni eht rof noitaicerppa sih desserpxe arumihsiN forP ,hceeps gnisolc sih nI

Mr Saleh stated that Indonesia already has several policies that support the adoption of this technology in Indonesia.&nbsp; For Thailand, Carbon Recycling development has not been integrated into the 2030 country roadmap yet. The session highlighted key challenges facing deployment of this technology within the region, including cost reduction, demand creation, and international collaboration.

He made several suggestions for consideration by Asian nations regarding CCUS deployment, such as allowing sufficient time for&nbsp; developing legislation, particularly in light of wider policy commitments.

The four speakers of the webinar were:

Mr Anthony Gunawan, Founder and CEO of Wakuliner, a culinary online platform from Indonesia;

Dr Lucia Cusmano, Head of the SME and Entrepreneurship Division of the OECD Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities;
Dr Dionisius Narjoko, Senior Economist, ERIA.

The main messages that emerged from the discussion included:

There is no unique &lsquo;new normal&rsquo; for ASEAN MSMEs: many variations of new normal are emerging depending on the individual characteristics of each firm- based on sector in which they operate, skill level of employees, integration in regional and global networks, etc;
Irrespective of what the new normal means for ASEAN MSMEs, being agile and able to rapidly adapt to the changing business landscape is key to overcome challenges in the short and medium term, including disruptions of GVCs and traditional regional networks;
Government support (fiscal stimulus, tax deductions, loans and guarantee schemes, etc) is and will continue to be crucial but to restore pre-crisis demand new and innovative policy tools may be required;
The acceleration of online activities requires investments in digital infrastructure and in skills to make MSMEs employees able to quickly adapt to new digitally enabled business models and seize emerging opportunities.

Dr Lucia Cusmano, Head of SME and Entrepreneurship of OECD, mentioned that, according to OECD estimates, the impact of COVID-19 may result in up to a 6% drop in global GDP and 50% of SMEs worldwide are at risk for bankruptcy in the short period. Acceleration in the digital transformation, reorganisation of the global value chains and possible reshoring of some activities to developed countries, preparedness to adapt for the whole business team are important points for MSMEs to consider to survive and to benefit from rising opportunities.

Using the example of her own company, she explained how employees, vendors, and customers are satisfied when they know how they contribute to plastic reduction efforts embedded in the business model of her company. She also noted the importance of innovation in implementing better sustainability practices for a better future.&nbsp;</p><p>Prof Kim highlighted the importance of integrating green business models as part of the development of MSMEs. Technological advances are important to scale up green tech adoption.&nbsp; He mentioned that there is a growing attention to this topic in Korea and the Korean government is supporting MSMEs to adopt green technologies via a new policy called the &#039;Green New Deal&#039;.</p><p>Dr Anbumozhi explained how MSMEs are part of the socio-economic fabric and play an important role to promote sustainability. MSMEs can operate in different contexts: in clusters, as part of global value chains, or predominantly in domestic markets. Depending on these characteristics the way they can &lsquo;go green&rsquo; may differ. He also highlighted the importance of the circular economy framework to move from a linear economic model to a circular one. Dr Anbumozhi mentioned the important role that the private sector has to play in the development of ASEAN smart cities. However, he also mentioned some of the challenges that exist for MSMEs to become greener, in particular, access to finance is critical for MSMEs. In many cases, the banking sector is not ready to finance green innovations. There is an opportunity for city governments, through smart city development, to develop new financial instruments to support the green transition.</p><p>During the Q&amp;A session, themes that emerged included: (i) the increasing role of the MSMEs to define sustainability in a broad way that includes practices protecting the environment, reinvigorating the local economy, and fostering social inclusion&nbsp; (ii) the emerging trend for potential business sectors to adopt shared sustainability values (ii) the adoption of circular business models.</p><h2>Related Publications</h2><ul><li><a title="[Policy Brief] Implications of the COVID-19 Crisis for the Energy Sector and Climate Change in ASEAN" href="/database-and-programmes/policy-brief-implications-of-the-covid-19-crisis-for-the-energy-sector-and-climate-change-in-asean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Policy Brief] Implications of the COVID-19 Crisis for the Energy Sector and Climate Change in ASEAN</a></li><li><a title="Industry 4.0: Empowering ASEAN for the Circular Economy&nbsp;" href="/research/industry-40-empowering-asean-for-the-circular-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Industry 4.0: Empowering ASEAN for the Circular Economy&nbsp;</a></li><li><a title="Enhancing the Readiness of ASEAN Smart Cities&nbsp;" href="/database-and-programmes/enhancing-the-readiness-of-asean-smart-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancing the Readiness of ASEAN Smart Cities&nbsp;</a></li></ul>";s:10:"image_name";s:39:"/uploads/news/20200924/pict_800x450.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:248:"<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-7vK-eadIM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:9607:"ERIA Holds Webinar on Sustainability Practices for MSMEs in a COVID-19 World and Beyond ERIA Holds Webinar on Sustainability Practices for MSMEs in a COVID-19 World and Beyond Jakarta, 24 September 2020: ERIA hosted the&nbsp;MSMEs Talk #5- Sustainability Practices for MSMEs in a COVID-19 World and Beyond.&nbsp;This webinar concluded the first part of the MSMEs series organized under ERIA&rsquo;s Strategy and Partnership Programme, funded by Australia.

Using the example of her own company, she explained how employees, vendors, and customers are satisfied when they know how they contribute to plastic reduction efforts embedded in the business model of her company. She also noted the importance of innovation in implementing better sustainability practices for a better future.&nbsp;
Prof Kim highlighted the importance of integrating green business models as part of the development of MSMEs. Technological advances are important to scale up green tech adoption.&nbsp; He mentioned that there is a growing attention to this topic in Korea and the Korean government is supporting MSMEs to adopt green technologies via a new policy called the 'Green New Deal'.
Dr Anbumozhi explained how MSMEs are part of the socio-economic fabric and play an important role to promote sustainability. MSMEs can operate in different contexts: in clusters, as part of global value chains, or predominantly in domestic markets. Depending on these characteristics the way they can &lsquo;go green&rsquo; may differ. He also highlighted the importance of the circular economy framework to move from a linear economic model to a circular one. Dr Anbumozhi mentioned the important role that the private sector has to play in the development of ASEAN smart cities. However, he also mentioned some of the challenges that exist for MSMEs to become greener, in particular, access to finance is critical for MSMEs. In many cases, the banking sector is not ready to finance green innovations. There is an opportunity for city governments, through smart city development, to develop new financial instruments to support the green transition.
During the Q&amp;A session, themes that emerged included: (i) the increasing role of the MSMEs to define sustainability in a broad way that includes practices protecting the environment, reinvigorating the local economy, and fostering social inclusion&nbsp; (ii) the emerging trend for potential business sectors to adopt shared sustainability values (ii) the adoption of circular business models.

With more than 300 participants from the Asia-Pacific region and beyond, the discussion gathered views from four ASEAN countries (the Philippines, Viet Nam, Singapore, and Indonesia) and the ASEAN region as a whole. The webinar was organized under ERIA&rsquo;s Strategy and Partnership programme, funded by Australia.&nbsp;
The webinar was opened with welcoming remarks from the Chief Operating Officer of ERIA, Mr Koji Hachiyama. In his remarks, Mr Hachiyama noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in regional global value chains (GVCs) and triggered important changes in the way people work and interact. He highlighted the importance of deepening regional economic cooperation also strengthening seamless connectivity within East and Southeast Asia, under the EAS framework. (Policy Brief)

GVCs are global production networks for the development of a product or a service where activities, tasks, and production of components occur across multiple locations in different countries. Southeast and East Asia are particularly well integrated in GVCs and they strongly contributed to the economic development and integration of the region over the last decades. As shown by ERIA research, GVCs have become more complex following decades of trade and investment liberalisation, high growth in infrastructure development, and the information and communication technology revolution which have created increasingly interconnected regions. &nbsp;However, the pandemic has heavily disrupted GVCs due to lock-down measures and travel disruptions.
The main messages that emerged from the discussion include:

The extent by which GVC were disrupted and ASEAN MSMEs affected largely depends on the sector in which they operate and on their degree of connectivity to international markets and suppliers. Companies in sectors such as tourism have been disproportionally affected;
The importance of being creative and seeing opportunities to diversify both demand and supply. For example, Dr Pananond mentioned Thai hotels which quickly adapted and are now becoming quarantine facilities as tourist are in small numbers. Ms Suhartini explained how her company quickly diversified the production of personal care products to also include organic hand sanitiser;
The importance for governments to facilitate the development of domestic markets, especially for large ASEAN countries in order to become more resilient to future shocks. Policy makers also have a role to play to maintain and restore connectivity (such as travel bubbles) as well as to improve the regulatory framework to continue to attract FDI;
Innovation and technology offer opportunities but can also represent a challenge: they will become even more important during the post-pandemic recovery to develop domestic markets, attract FDI and upgrade the activities of many ASEAN MSMEs. Automation can also represent a risk in terms of job losses but at the same time it may strengthen resilience of business operations;
For the above-mentioned reasons, upskilling and reskilling of workers, especially in MSMEs, is key. The availability of skilled labour is one of the key determinants for the relocation of larger firms and FDI attraction;
While re-shoring is costly and takes time, a possible long-term consequence of the pandemic is to make GVCs shorter: more regional and less global. This is why policy makers should continue to promote economic integration at ASEAN and East Asia level.

The main messages that emerged from the discussion include:

Women&rsquo;s participation in economic activity and global value chains is key to promote greater inclusive economic development resulting in poverty reduction and livelihood improvements within ASEAN and beyond in the post-pandemic phase.
Digital transformation and innovation are able to accelerate the role of women-owned and women-led entrepreneurs during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;
As the pandemic is accelerating the transition towards digital economies, policymakers need to pay increasing attention to digital gender equality to empower women for future careers. For instance, by making sure women have adequate access to digital skills.
The importance of government policy to support a conducive environment for women&rsquo;s participation in the economy including lowering barriers to credit and access to finance and enhancing protections within regulatory frameworks.
Promoting public-private partnership (PPP) to accelerate women's participation in digitalisation and economic activity is also an important way to support women entrepreneurship.

Ms Ratha Chea, Founder &amp; CEO of Khmum Technology from Cambodia, stated that the challenges for women-led businesses are visible in the often limited support in finance, ICT, skills, and public policy support. She highlighted the importance of bridging the gender gap in economic sectors to promote sustained economic activity.&nbsp;

It has attracted more than 120 participants from the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.&nbsp;The topic of women&rsquo;s economic empowerment in the digital economy is a growing area of work for ERIA&rsquo;s Strategy and Partnership Programme.</p><p>In her opening remarks, Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, ERIA&rsquo;s Director of Strategy and Partnership, stated that women tend to be less represented in Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and jobs globally and across ASEAN. She added that despite the fact that ASEAN is one of the regions with the fastest-growing digital economies in the world, more women need to access the opportunity offered by the digital transformation. The majority of women in science across ASEAN work on health and social sciences rather than technology, engineering, and math. Thus, the importance of increasing women&rsquo;s access to STEM education and jobs is a key step towards inclusive economic development in ASEAN.&nbsp;</p><p>Four speakers shared their views and perspectives:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Chan Yin Yin, COO &amp; Co-Founder, BotDistrikt (Singapore)</li><li>Mazlita Mat Hassan, Co-Founder, RECQA.com (Malaysia)&nbsp;</li><li>Kingkeo Doungsavanh, Director, Data Com (Laos PDR)</li><li>Liza Noonan, ASEAN Director, CSIRO&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The main messages derived from the discussion were:</p><ul><li>The importance of gender diversity in the workforce to promote innovation and inclusive digital economic development, which is supported by a growing body of evidence and research.</li><li>The importance of providing platforms, access to education, and training to promote women&rsquo;s empowerment in STEM and digital economy activity.&nbsp;</li><li>The need for technology to bridge the gap between the urban-rural divide, as women in rural areas are at risk to continue to be worse off in the transition towards digital economies.</li><li>The role of both the government and the private sector to support initiatives ensuring gender diversity in the workforce.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Ms Mazlita Mat Hassan, CEO, and Co-Founder of RECQA.com from Malaysia, develops RECQA.com as a platform for sharing collective knowledge with communities and organisation in collaboration with the Ministry of Education of Malaysia. She noted the importance of technology to reach out to marginalised groups, for instance, to bridge the gap between teachers and students or urban and rural areas. She also mentioned the importance of promoting gender diversity, as e-commerce and the start-up ecosystem remains dominated by men. She also mentioned the importance of making girls and women feel accepted in these male-dominated environments by projecting an image of diversity and inclusion.</p><p>Ms Chan Yin Yin, COO &amp; Co-Founder, BotDistrikt from Singapore, developed an affordable chatbot platform targeted at MSMEs in Singapore. She started her journey in technology with hands-on experience in e-commerce and the digital economy. She highlighted the obstacles girls and women face, in particular the existing stereotypes about women&#039;s participation in STEM, in Asia as elsewhere. She highlighted the importance of having a good role model, mentor, and determination for women to participate in digital economic activity.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Kingkeo Doungsavanh, Director, Data Com from Lao PDR shared her experience about how when she began her career, the ICT sector was not an easy environment for women. She mentioned that most women in Lao PDR, particularly in rural areas, still work in the agriculture sector and do not have access to training enabling them to have a job in the digital economy. Therefore, she highlighted the importance of providing access to education and training for upskilling and reskilling female workers combined with better access to the internet to promote women&#039;s participation in the digital economy.

It has attracted more than 120 participants from the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.&nbsp;The topic of women&rsquo;s economic empowerment in the digital economy is a growing area of work for ERIA&rsquo;s Strategy and Partnership Programme.
In her opening remarks, Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, ERIA&rsquo;s Director of Strategy and Partnership, stated that women tend to be less represented in Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and jobs globally and across ASEAN. She added that despite the fact that ASEAN is one of the regions with the fastest-growing digital economies in the world, more women need to access the opportunity offered by the digital transformation. The majority of women in science across ASEAN work on health and social sciences rather than technology, engineering, and math. Thus, the importance of increasing women&rsquo;s access to STEM education and jobs is a key step towards inclusive economic development in ASEAN.&nbsp;
Four speakers shared their views and perspectives:&nbsp;

Chan Yin Yin, COO &amp; Co-Founder, BotDistrikt (Singapore)
Mazlita Mat Hassan, Co-Founder, RECQA.com (Malaysia)&nbsp;
Kingkeo Doungsavanh, Director, Data Com (Laos PDR)
Liza Noonan, ASEAN Director, CSIRO&nbsp;

The main messages derived from the discussion were:

The importance of gender diversity in the workforce to promote innovation and inclusive digital economic development, which is supported by a growing body of evidence and research.
The importance of providing platforms, access to education, and training to promote women&rsquo;s empowerment in STEM and digital economy activity.&nbsp;
The need for technology to bridge the gap between the urban-rural divide, as women in rural areas are at risk to continue to be worse off in the transition towards digital economies.
The role of both the government and the private sector to support initiatives ensuring gender diversity in the workforce.&nbsp;

Ms Mazlita Mat Hassan, CEO, and Co-Founder of RECQA.com from Malaysia, develops RECQA.com as a platform for sharing collective knowledge with communities and organisation in collaboration with the Ministry of Education of Malaysia. She noted the importance of technology to reach out to marginalised groups, for instance, to bridge the gap between teachers and students or urban and rural areas. She also mentioned the importance of promoting gender diversity, as e-commerce and the start-up ecosystem remains dominated by men. She also mentioned the importance of making girls and women feel accepted in these male-dominated environments by projecting an image of diversity and inclusion.
Ms Chan Yin Yin, COO &amp; Co-Founder, BotDistrikt from Singapore, developed an affordable chatbot platform targeted at MSMEs in Singapore. She started her journey in technology with hands-on experience in e-commerce and the digital economy. She highlighted the obstacles girls and women face, in particular the existing stereotypes about women's participation in STEM, in Asia as elsewhere. She highlighted the importance of having a good role model, mentor, and determination for women to participate in digital economic activity.&nbsp;
Ms Kingkeo Doungsavanh, Director, Data Com from Lao PDR shared her experience about how when she began her career, the ICT sector was not an easy environment for women. She mentioned that most women in Lao PDR, particularly in rural areas, still work in the agriculture sector and do not have access to training enabling them to have a job in the digital economy. Therefore, she highlighted the importance of providing access to education and training for upskilling and reskilling female workers combined with better access to the internet to promote women's participation in the digital economy. She also highlighted the importance of government initiatives, for instance, the provision of STEM training for women and youth in Lao PDR.&nbsp;
Ms Liza Noonan, ASEAN Director of CSIRO, Australia&rsquo;s science agency, explained how the agency is strongly supporting gender equality in science and technology, including across ASEAN, by implementing several initiatives to promote gender diversity in STEM and the digital economy. She described CSIRO&rsquo;s initiative &lsquo;SAGE&rsquo; (Science Australia Gender Equity) and how diversity, including gender diversity, is associated with more innovation and better scientific results, as diverse teams can look at problems from different perspectives. She highlighted several key factors and initiatives to empower women and promote gender diversity including the provision of STEM platforms for women to interact and networks and find role models as well as promoting women &lsquo;STEM ambassadors&rsquo; to become highly visible role models.&nbsp;
During the Q&amp;A session, themes that emerged included i) various country -level initiatives to promote women&rsquo;s participation in STEM and digital economy; ii) challenges and solutions to empower women from the perspective of the urban-rural divide; iii) the importance of all firms, large and small, to empower women and create diverse teams.

Ms Nur Hidayah Kaser, Managing Director of KnowledgeHiveInternational, Malaysia, stated that key elements for developing entrepreneurial mindsets are the ability to seize opportunities, to understand business markets, and to establish and nurture collaborations.&nbsp; To create a conducive and vibrant ecosystem, she also highlighted the importance of upskilling especially digital-related skills, mentorships, innovation and the ability to takes risks and manage them appropriately.

Mr T J Ooi, Founder and Principal Consultant of Curated Connectors, the co-organiser of the series, shared the importance of continued engagement in conversations from all stakeholders in the E-S-I ecosystem, as it would inevitably open doors to new ideas. He further echoed the sentiments shared by the speakers to adopt a posture of continuous learning, embrace an open mindset and proactively seek mentors to grow.

The ASEAN region is one of the fastest-growing digital economies in the world, and this transition towards digital technologies is being accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. To build inclusive digital economies and societies, it is crucial for women to have equal access to opportunities offered by digital technologies, especially in terms of more sophisticated forms of access, such as access to skills, entrepreneurship opportunity and leadership positions in both the private and the public sector.
Equal representation in policymaking bodies regulating and shaping the digital economy is also crucial to make sure different points of views are taken into account and to effectively tackle potential biases and discriminations associated with new digital tools affecting women.

In his remarks, Prof Nishimura recounted the projects and collaboration that ERIA and OECD had developed together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mr Gurria acknowledged the success of&nbsp;the ASEAN SME Policy Index, saying that &lsquo;the Index has become an important reference within the ASEAN system for measuring&nbsp;[the]&nbsp;progress of reforms in areas such as SMEs and innovation policies, SMEs and women entrepreneurship, SMEs and business climate issues, and SMEs and green growth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He also reminisced about the signing of the first MoU with ERIA at the Chateau de la&nbsp;Muette&nbsp;in Paris on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of Japan&rsquo;s accession to the OECD.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thanks to this co-operation, and through the OECD Southeast Asia Regional Programme, that then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and I launched together, we have been strengthening our collaboration with countries in the region in a broad range of policy areas.

<p><strong>Jakarta, 27 July 2022:&nbsp;</strong>The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) co-hosted a G20 High-Level Forum (HLF) on Trade, Investment, and Industry with the International Economic Association (IEA), the Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Indonesia, the Ministry of Trade of the Republic of Indonesia, and the Ministry of Investment of the Republic of Indonesia (BKPM) on July 26 and 27, 2022. On the second day, the theme of the sessions was taken from the G20 Report titled &lsquo;New Normal, New Technologies, New Financing&rsquo;, edited by Dr Lili Yan Ing, Lead Advisor of ERIA, and Professor Dani Rodrik, President of IEA.</p>
<p>The first panel was chaired by the former Minister of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia, Dr Chatib Basri, focusing on global economic recovery issues. The panelists of this session, including Dr Vera Songwe of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Professor Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California Berkeley, and Professor Jayati Ghosh of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, each came up with recommendations for the G20. Dr Songwe highlighted the importance of a facility focused on liquidity and sustainability that can help Africa to improve&nbsp; market access as well as the importance to strengthen energy transition in the future. Professor Obstfeld recommended that the G20 improve cooperation and create a common framework, particularly for debt treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Regarding the global recovery spending, Professor Ghosh pointed out that such spending should be broad-based and cover all countries in the world, while also recognizing all important aspects, including environmental and inequality issues. &lsquo;We have to work on unitary taxation of MNCs based on formulaic apportionment and a global asset register to enable wealth taxation,&rsquo; Highlighted by Professor Ghosh.</p>
<p>This second panel focused on the importance, opportunities, and threats of digital transformation. ERIA&rsquo;s Dr Lili Yan Ing was a panelist in this session, accompanied by Dr Zia Qureshi of Brookings Institute and Dr Albert Park of the Asian Development Bank. Dr Ing highlighted several important recommendations for digital transformation that the G20 needs to implement including existing commitments for digital transformation and digital trade as well as improving the quality of privacy and competition law. &lsquo;The G20 should promote efforts to improve preparedness of the people to reduce digital divide within and across countries. This call for the G20 better cooperation in providing necessary incentives and supports for technology adoption for developing countries,&rsquo; Dr Ing added.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the second session, Dr Qureshi urged the importance of government to support public R&amp;D on technology and improved digital skills to foster digital sectors. Government can implement stronger programs for worker upskilling, reskilling, and lifelong learning in digital technology. Finally, Dr Park highlighted the importance of digitalization in the economy and recommended the G20 to build digital skills and strengthen digital readiness to narrow the digital divide.</p>
<p>The last panel was chaired by ERIA&rsquo;s Dr Fauziah Zen and discussed new financing options for energy transition. Professor Justin Yifu Lin of Peking University, Professor Ishac Diwan of Paris School of Economics, and Mr Robert Seung of Tunas Sawa Erma Group were the panelist in this last session. Professor Lin underlined the need for governments to improve regulations in relation to green ideas and actions as well as the need for multilateral international organizations to provide funding, particularly to developing countries, to overcome green transition challenges. Professor Diwan highlighted two tracks to scale up green finance: (1) short term push through the $100 billion pledge and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs); and (2) long-term reforms through enhancing the role of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and expanding carbon markets. Finally, from the private sector side, Mr Seung highlighted how sustainable investment can change the lives of indigenous people through better access to health, education, and jobs.</p>
<p>The HLF ended with closing remarks by the Chair of the G20 TII Working Group, Mr Djatmiko Bris Witjaksono. In his remarks, Mr Djatmiko echoed ERIA&rsquo;s President's messages on the importance of international coordination in times of recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic and the looming global economic downturn.</p>

However, despite the rapid economic growth generated by robust technologies and digitalisation, inequalities remain in many countries, including women’s participation in the digital economy. Data show that reducing gender gap in the digital space will not only benefit women but also contribute to societies and economies. Thus, cooperation amongst stakeholders is pivotal to narrow the gender divide and provide women larger access and opportunities in the digital economy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">As part of the eCommerce Week organised by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and eTrade for All, the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) co-organised How Can Women Digital Entrepreneurs Boost Inclusion? Peer-learning Dialogue Across Regions,<em> </em>a thematic session held on 28 April 2022 to discuss challenges, opportunities, and new approaches to forward-looking strategies on sustainability in the region. ERIA is a partner of eTrade for All. The session was part of a series of events highlighting the positive impact of promoting inclusive digital economies.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">To highlight the importance of female entrepreneurship in the digital ecosystem to promote inclusivity, the session was participated in by leading women entrepreneurs from Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa and moderated by Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, ERIA’s director for strategy and partnership.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Opening the session was Ms Garcia-Quiles Viridiana, programme management officer of eTrade for Women at UNCTAD, who pointed out that women lag behind men in participation in the digital economy. She added that narrowing the gender divide in the digital economy is pivotal to boost inclusive economic development. She enumerated three key strategies to close this gap: boost digital skills for girls and women to engage in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) area; promote more women leaders to become role models for other women; and support inclusive digital businesses in providing women-led businesses with a platform to connect and grow as reflected in the eTrade for Women programme by UNCTAD.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Ms Aimi Ramlee, director of digital innovation and growth at Tyne Solutions and co-founder of the SoutheastAsiaWomen.org, discussed the digital economy ecosystem for women in Southeast Asia. She said that limitations of the digital ecosystem and infrastructure have become some of the main barriers over the years for some countries in Southeast Asia. She added, however, that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the push towards digitalisation and may provide more opportunities for women’s participation. With this positive development, she also noticed that more targeted government policies have been created in the region to serve a better digital ecosystem for leveraging women’s participation in the digital economy. Ms Ramlee also shared information on SoutheastAsiaWomen.org, an organisation that provides mentorship programme amongst women in the region.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Ms Birame Sock, founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Kwely Inc, shared her experience building a start-up in Senegal, Africa. She conveyed the need to build a more conducive business ecosystem rather than focus on building digital infrastructure in Africa. She also cited the importance of access to digital resources, skills, and entrepreneurial mindsets to enable more involvement of women in the digital economy. She weighted the importance of women supporting women to break the gender bias and provide a more supportive working environment for women.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Ms Claudia Rosales, founder and CEO of Women Ework, shared her experience building her human resource company in Latin America, and its objective of creating a talent pool to support women in building back a better future as too many had lost their jobs during the pandemic. She underscored the importance of enhancing and empowering leadership skills for women through different activities including training, workshops, and dialogues. She also shared her experience as a member of UNCTAD’s eTradeforWomen programme,  which enabled her to better understand how women can overcome challenges, to take utmost advantage of what the digital economy ecosystem offers, to enhance her entrepreneurship skills, and to gain more networks and visibility in the digital world.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Ms Poornima Jayawardana, financial sector specialist at the Asian Development Bank (ADB), stated that accelerating the progress of gender equality and promoting women’s economic empowerment have been some of ADB’s priorities towards 2030. She shared some ADB strategies to promote inclusivity, including promoting innovative technology, committing to support countries across Asia and the Pacific in developing and improving their regulatory frameworks, providing technical assistance and knowledge work in ensuring that women and girls are equitably benefitting from jobs and investment across Asia and the Pacific, as implemented, for instance, in the Eastern Indonesia Financial Innovation Lab, which helps women entrepreneurs access financial services. She mentioned ADB’s key lessons in promoting inclusive economic development in the post-recovery period, including the commitment to eradicate the gender gap, provide more opportunities for women in STEM and information communication technology, provide better digital literacy and infrastructure, and apply a social-norm approach to break stereotypes of women.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:49:"/uploads/news/2022_april_unctad-jakarta-5-800.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:275:"<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lg5J1rNGZVo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>                        ";s:4:"tags";N;s:6:"editor";s:7:"testing";s:6:"author";N;s:6:"doc_no";N;s:6:"period";N;s:14:"article_status";N;s:10:"event_time";N;s:5:"venue";N;s:5:"major";N;s:16:"article_keywords";N;s:9:"organizer";N;s:12:"image_name_2";N;s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";N;s:9:"published";s:1:"1";s:9:"highlight";s:1:"0";s:8:"order_id";s:3:"100";s:12:"created_date";N;s:13:"modified_date";s:19:"2022-08-12 21:02:58";s:11:"modified_by";s:1:"1";s:7:"old_url";N;s:10:"majorEmail";N;s:9:"education";N;s:10:"experience";N;s:12:"publications";N;s:6:"others";N;s:13:"presentations";N;s:7:"feature";N;s:11:"sub_experts";s:2:"20";s:15:"sub_dep_experts";N;s:13:"meta_keywords";s:91:"Global Dialogue on Women and Digital Entrepreneurship Featured in UNCTAD’s eCommerce Week";s:16:"meta_description";s:91:"Global Dialogue on Women and Digital Entrepreneurship Featured in UNCTAD’s eCommerce Week";s:5:"sc_id";s:1:"0";}i:40;O:8:"stdClass":46:{s:9:"short_des";N;s:10:"article_id";s:4:"7296";s:12:"article_type";s:10:"multimedia";s:3:"uri";s:128:"how-private-companies-in-indonesia-combat-marine-plastic-debris-private-sector-plays-fundamental-role-to-utilising-plastic-waste";s:8:"pub_type";s:1:"0";s:5:"title";s:135:"‘How Private Companies in Indonesia Combat Marine Plastic Debris’: Private Sector Plays Fundamental Role to Utilising Plastic Waste";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2021-09-21";s:11:"posted_year";s:4:"2021";s:12:"posted_month";s:1:"9";s:7:"content";s:8956:"<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Jakarta, 21 September 2021: </strong>Private sector plays a fundamental role in enhancing plastic waste management by providing funding for investment and green jobs, said an Indonesian Ministry official in the first online event named ‘How Private Companies in Indonesia Combat Marine Plastic Debris’ organised by the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris (RKC-MPD).</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Mr Rofi Alhanif, Deputy Assistant for Waste and Wastewater Management at the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment of the Republic Indonesia, underscored in his speech that private sector has a big potential to contribute in reducing or replacing plastic use, redesigning plastic products and packaging, doubling plastic waste collection and recycling capacity, and building or expanding waste disposal facilities.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">As an example of the private sector’s contribution, Mr Alhanif cited the waste to energy (WtE) plant in Benowo, Surabaya in East Java and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) plant in Cilacap.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">‘To achieve the national target to reduce marine plastic debris up to 70% by 2025, Indonesia requires US$5.1 billion for investment and US$1.1 billion per year for operation to run effective waste management and increase recycling rate. This is an opportunity for private sector (to invest),’ said Mr Alhanif.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">The webinar featured speakers from multinational company Danone Indonesia, two Indonesian green start-ups namely Rekosistem and Rebricks, as well as a representative from Japan Clean Ocean Material Alliance (CLOMA) Indonesia Working Group.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Mr Karyanto Wibowo, Sustainability Director of Danone Indonesia, emphasized that the company supports the Government of Indonesia by committing to recover more plastics that they use by 2025, which focuses on collection, education, and innovation.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">‘We (Danone and Veolia Indonesia) are currently working to triple the capacity of recycling plant in Pasuruan, East Java. We are also building an integrated waste management site in Lamongan and Bali with the capacity up to 180 tons per day,’ said Mr Wibowo, who is also the Chairman of Packaging and Recycling Association for Indonesia Sustainable Environment (PRAISE).</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">‘Other initiatives include the expansion of plastic bottle collection centres in 17 districts and massive plastic bottle collection that partners with 10,000 scavengers in Bali,’ he added.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO of Rebricks Indonesia, Ms Novita Tan, introduced her company’s efforts to transform rejected plastic waste that often ends up in landfill or leaks to water bodies into building materials such as pavers, hollow blocks, and rosters.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">‘We are working with thousands of volunteers from Jakarta and other cities who have donated their rejected plastic waste to Rebricks’ drop points located in Jakarta. <a href="https://rebricks.id/">Rebricks</a> plans to expand our initiative to other cities, in collaboration with the government, NGOs, and private companies,’ she said.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Mr Ernest Layman, CEO and Co-founder of <a href="https://rekosistem.com/">Rekosistem</a>, presented his company’s digital platforms contributing to a circular economy by improving the waste value chain. His approach revolves around the visualization of information, on topics such as waste accounting, market insight data, and transportation cost reduction with the aim of encouraging user participation in problem-solving.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">‘We aim to enable and empower current waste workers to collect more, segregate properly, and ensure the proper type of waste to be sent to any specific recycling centre,’ he explained. </p><h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges for Private Sector and Needs for Collaboration</h2><p style="font-weight: 400;">The main challenge for Rebricks, according to Ms Tan is the fact that the collected waste exceeds the demand of recycled products.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">'We need the support from the government and business sector by using our recycled products for public facilities, CSR projects, or research and development purposes,' she argued.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge according to Mr Layman is the need to scale up existing initiatives, as the more waste is collected the more leverage we can create for the recycling businesses. Moreover, shifting to responsible waste collection comes with an initial investment cost for infrastructures.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">‘However, investors are still hesitant to put their investment on such environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Having stakeholders on board in different levels of the value chain is essential to address the challenges,’ he concluded.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Mr Wibowo added that all stakeholders need to collaborate to make well-structured, substantial and collective actions to make a difference.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Mr Osachi Takagi from CLOMA reiterated that his Alliance, which hosts more than 440 private companies in Japan, seeks to assist Indonesia to achieve the target to reduce 70% of plastic going into the oceans by 2025.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">‘We continue to collaborate with organizations like ERIA and local governments like in Surabaya, East Java, as well as other private companies. It has been difficult to conduct field activities in Indonesia due to the ongoing pandemic, but the Private Sector Platform proposed by ERIA’s RKC-MPD team has been a useful platform connecting us with potential business partners,’ he said.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Indonesian as well we non-Indonesian companies attending the event were invited to take part in <a href="https://rkcmpd-eria.org/story">RKC-MPD</a>’s online Private Sector Platform, which showcases positive business activities that take place in ASEAN+3 region, contributing to plastic waste reduction and/or to marine plastic pollution prevention.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">‘By participating in the platform, the private companies will be better known to potential consumers within the region, be able to find potential business opportunities, can promote the company’s sustainability efforts, and appeal to potential investors,’ explained Ms Ayako Mizuno, Programme Manager of the RKC-MPD.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">This was the first edition of the series of online events focusing on the private sector’s contribution to address the marine plastic issue. In his opening and closing remarks, Mr Michikazu Kojima, ERIA’s Research Fellow recognised the important role played by the private sector in combating marine plastic waste.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">‘Private companies are pioneering in innovation, development of new technologies and products, creation of alternative materials to plastic, ensuring the 3R approaches, and implementing proper waste disposal and others. But one company alone will not be able to change whole economic system,’ argued Mr Kojima.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">‘Private sector needs collaboration and information exchange to foster economic development as well as to address marine plastic issue, given the deeply integrated economic system in which we live.’</p><h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Related Documents</h2><p class="pdf"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18GzVIuCT2ndfA5nv95nJMznceCpcJ3NK/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr Rofi Alhanif’s presentation</a></p><p class="pdf"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11IS9Iesqb_fM3EinVppNUVoJOZBOmTeJ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr Karyanto Wibowo’s presentation</a></p><p class="pdf"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_psr5G0yvQ2lHBZQNhOqkii_9qBCRXGm/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ms Novita Tan’s presentation</a></p><p class="pdf"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CSMhDrcbnJKr5UlCPkD5U3KUX2kjQWy-/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr Ernest Layman’s presentation</a></p><p class="pdf"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15pe1vmWe54_0gQxar6x6FG66JxBr_nWk/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr Osachi Takagi’s presentation</a></p><p class="pdf"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b2YFEvDwsPBjhK3q9H1SfvFjmyUWAX0G/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ms Ayako Mizuno’s presentation</a></p><p>Note: Reposted from RKC-MPD's website. <a title="Original post in RKC-MPD's website" href="https://rkcmpd-eria.org/newsupdates/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See original post here</a>. </p>";s:10:"image_name";s:178:"/uploads/news/20210921/2021_sept_eria_how-private-companies-in-indonesia-combat-marine-plastic-debris-private-sector-plays-fundamental-role-to-utilizing-plastic-waste_800x450.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:248:"<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ivewejlfzbw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:15045:"â€˜How Private Companies in Indonesia Combat Marine Plastic Debrisâ€™: Private Sector Plays Fundamental Role to Utilising Plastic Waste â€˜How Private Companies in Indonesia Combat Marine Plastic Debrisâ€™: Private Sector Plays Fundamental Role to Utilising Plastic Waste Jakarta, 21 September 2021:&nbsp;Private sector plays a fundamental role in enhancing plastic waste management by providing funding for investment and green jobs, said an Indonesian Ministry official in the first online event named &lsquo;How Private Companies in Indonesia Combat Marine Plastic Debris&rsquo; organised by the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris (RKC-MPD).

Co-founder and CEO of Rebricks Indonesia, Ms Novita Tan, introduced her company&rsquo;s efforts to transform rejected plastic waste that often ends up in landfill or leaks to water bodies into building materials such as pavers, hollow blocks, and rosters.
&lsquo;We are working with thousands of volunteers from Jakarta and other cities who have donated their rejected plastic waste to Rebricks&rsquo; drop points located in Jakarta.&nbsp;Rebricks&nbsp;plans to expand our initiative to other cities, in collaboration with the government, NGOs, and private companies,&rsquo; she said.
Mr Ernest Layman, CEO and Co-founder of&nbsp;Rekosistem, presented his company&rsquo;s digital&nbsp;platforms contributing to a&nbsp;circular economy by improving the waste value chain.&nbsp;His approach revolves around the visualization of information, on topics such as waste accounting, market insight data, and transportation cost reduction with the aim of encouraging user participation in problem-solving.
&lsquo;We aim to enable and empower current waste workers to collect more, segregate properly, and ensure the proper type of waste to be sent to any specific recycling centre,&rsquo; he explained.&nbsp;
Challenges for Private Sector and Needs for Collaboration
The main challenge for Rebricks, according to Ms Tan is the fact that the collected waste exceeds the demand of recycled products.
'We need the support from the government and business sector by using our recycled products for public facilities, CSR projects, or research and development purposes,' she argued.
Another challenge according to Mr&nbsp;Layman&nbsp;is the need to scale up existing initiatives, as the more waste is collected the more leverage we can create for the recycling businesses. Moreover, shifting to responsible waste collection comes with an initial investment cost for infrastructures.
&lsquo;However, investors are still hesitant to put their investment on such environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Having stakeholders on board in different levels of the value chain is essential to address the challenges,&rsquo;&nbsp;he&nbsp;concluded.
Mr Wibowo added that all stakeholders need to collaborate to make well-structured, substantial and collective actions to make a difference.
Mr Osachi Takagi from CLOMA reiterated that his Alliance, which hosts more than 440 private companies in Japan, seeks to assist Indonesia to achieve the target to reduce 70% of plastic going into the oceans by 2025.
&lsquo;We continue to collaborate with organizations like ERIA and local governments like in Surabaya, East Java, as well as other private companies. It has been difficult to conduct field activities in Indonesia due to the ongoing pandemic, but the Private Sector Platform proposed by ERIA&rsquo;s RKC-MPD team has been a useful platform connecting us with potential business partners,&rsquo; he said.
Finally,&nbsp;Indonesian as well we non-Indonesian companies attending the event were invited to take part in&nbsp;RKC-MPD&rsquo;s online Private Sector Platform, which showcases positive&nbsp;business activities that take place in ASEAN+3 region, contributing to plastic waste reduction and/or to marine plastic pollution prevention.
&lsquo;By participating in the platform, the private companies will be better known to potential consumers within the region, be able to find potential business opportunities, can promote the company&rsquo;s sustainability efforts, and appeal to potential investors,&rsquo; explained Ms Ayako Mizuno, Programme Manager of the RKC-MPD.
This was the first edition of the series of online events focusing on the private sector&rsquo;s contribution to address the marine plastic issue. In his opening and closing remarks,&nbsp;Mr Michikazu Kojima, ERIA&rsquo;s Research Fellow&nbsp;recognised the important role played by the private sector in combating marine plastic waste.
&lsquo;Private companies are pioneering in innovation, development of new technologies and products, creation of alternative materials to plastic, ensuring the 3R approaches, and implementing proper waste disposal and others. But one company alone will not be able to change whole economic system,&rsquo; argued Mr Kojima.
&lsquo;Private sector needs collaboration and information exchange to&nbsp;foster economic development as well as to address marine plastic issue, given the deeply integrated economic system in which we live.&rsquo;

The Asian Network is a digital community dedicated to connecting like-minded individuals who can empower each other to make a positive impact within their communities and inspire the younger generation through speakers’ series, webinars, and virtual conferences.</p><p>The awardees for 2022 were Dr Darren Chua (Singapore) for disability awareness, Mr Ali Fayez (Afghanistan) for peace, Dr Skye Kinder (Australia) for health, Ms Saijai Liangpunsakul (Thailand) for technology for good, Ms Vivian Lim (Singapore) for gender equality, Mr The Huy Luong (Viet Nam) for social justice, Ms Emilie Palamy Pradichit (Thailand) for social justice, Ms Sherry Soon (Singapore) for invisible disability awareness, and Ms Catherine Sarah Young (Philippines) for the environment.</p><p>During the awarding ceremony, held virtually on 19 May 2022, Mr Ravindra Ngo, founder and chief executive officer of The Asian Network, welcomed and introduced the awardees. In his introductory speech, he emphasised that empathy and compassion to those who need them the most are important to tackle global challenges. He congratulated the awardees for their dedication, passion, and valuable work for community, society, and country.</p><p>In her opening remarks, Ms Antonella Noya, head of the Social Economy and Innovation Unit of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed thanks for the opportunity to send a good message on how and why it is possible to scale social impact of social enterprises on top of strengthening the social, economy, and policy ecosystem in different regions. She said she was counting on new generations to help address the challenges as met by OECD, which has demonstrated the importance of action to increase levels of social inclusion to provide jobs and promote digital transition. She noted that although Asia is the epicentre of global value chains, much of its population still lives below the poverty line and is excluded from the formal economy. She cited the need for increased awareness to achieve more resilient and inclusive growth. She said every actor in society and the economy has a role in promoting awareness and supporting the growth of business.</p><p>In her response, Ms Pradichit, founder and executive director of Manushya Foundation, shared her personal background as a political refugee since birth in the suburbs of France, and how she had witnessed inequalities and racial discrimination. She narrated how she used her personal story to focus on supporting marginalised communities and making local communities more visible and be at the centre of decision-making processes that concern them. She said she helps marginalised people know their rights, fight for social justice and equality, and amplify their voices. The Manushya Foundation is a women-led and innovative non-profit organisation promoting community empowerment to advance the human rights of marginalised communities and fight for social justice. </p><p><span style="font-family: sf_compact_textregular;">Ms Lim, co-founder of GEN, a non-profit organisation that works to close gender gaps, bridge generational differences, and find alternative voices to the general perspective, spoke of being passionate about building inclusive communities. She stated her belief in the need to understand cultural and gender diversities as one of the first steps to achieve progress in gender equity, especially in Asia. She cited the need to close gender gaps, bridge generational differences, and find alternative voices to the general perspective. She said understanding the unique gendered social structures is important to bridge the gaps and achieve gender equality.</span></p><p>Ms Young, a participatory artist whose work explores emerging technologies and alternative futures through interactive storytelling and sensory experiences, said she used her background in molecular biology, fine art, and interaction design to create interdisciplinary art projects about the environment. She specifically cited climate change as the focus of her work. She told her audience that the years ahead are years of repair of destruction by catastrophes that humans have created, such as fossil fuel emissions that lead to climate emergencies or habitat destruction causing diseases or rising inequality worldwide. She ended her response by stating that art and many disciplines play a part in planetary repair.</p><p>Dr Chua, founder of the Potter’s Clay Education, suffered a stroke when he was 24 years old. Unable to practise medicine, he became an inspirational speaker, empowerment coach, and health ambassador. The foundation is a boutique tuition centre set up in 2009 to help students achieve their best. In his response, Dr Chua spoke of pushing boundaries and demonstrating strength in helping others, and helping people realise their strength and gift. He also spoke of how mindset is the core of what people do but is also the foundation upon which their potential is formed. Thus, he said, people can use their mindset to add value to the people they want to impact, with the ultimate desire to do what is best for society.</p><p><span style="font-family: sf_compact_textregular;">Dr Kinder, vice chair of the Women’s Health Loddon Malee board, said in her response that she is an ardent advocate for rural and marginalised patients and their communities, and does clinical work in mental health. She said that geographic location continues to be a major predictor for the future of marginalised people and that, in Australia, those who live outside major cities continue to experience poorer health outcomes across almost every disease type. She now raises awareness, she said, about marginalised patients to ensure better support for them, whilst pointing out that geography should not predetermine one’s destiny. The Women’s Health Loddon Mallee is the regional women’s health service for communities across regional North-West Victoria, Australia.</span></p><p>Mr Fayez is a policy officer who advocates for the national adoption and localisation of the United Nations 2250 resolution on youth, peace, and security. He promotes a culture of tolerance, openness, and respect. In his response, he noted how he had learned that the terms of peace and security are much more politicised in conflict-affected countries like Afghanistan. He observed that although people often relate peace with political agreement, looking at terms of peace and security from a new perspective, promoting new concepts related to everyday life, and adjusting to compromise with one another’s response to emotions are steps to resolve disputes.</p><p>Diagnosed and living with vasculitis, Ms Soon, founder of Be Kind SG, said her experience of going through pain, suffering, and loss of opportunities made her realise what people with disabilities face, especially those with invisible disabilities. She said she used her experience to live a life that aims to create and inspire a kind and inclusive society for persons with special needs and those unable to find a stable job, or caregivers for people with special needs, through building relationships and empathy. Be Kind SG is a volunteer-led group whose mission is to create and inspire a kind and inclusive society for persons with invisible disabilities.</p><p>Mr Luong, co-founder of Äi Ä‘Æ°á»ng Nghe chuyá»‡n, is an openly gay jurist who works in the first non-governmental organisation working for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Viet Nam. He claimed that laws in several countries still prohibit LGBT rights and that although some countries are more advanced than others, what they are doing is still just a starting point in the LGBT movement. He said that to understand people, one must see how they treat people with less power. Similarly, he said, it is important to see how a society treats minority groups.</p><p>Ms Liangpunsakul, social impact director of Myanmar Innovation Lab, spoke of how technology brings joy and opportunity to young people, on top of enabling them to access global information. The Myanmar Innovation Lab, also known as Phandeeyar, is a technology seed accelerator that pioneers the use of technology to drive transformation and development.  Her work, she said, involves spearheading the use of technology to accelerate change. She noted, however, that technology divides people at the same time. Nonetheless, she remarked, technology can be used to raise awareness and impact democracy. She said that although technology allows people to communicate more but connect less outside the digital world, technology should essentially be about awareness and connection in a community.</p><p>Closing the awarding ceremony, Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, director of strategy and partnership at ERIA, congratulated the awardees and expressed how interesting it was to listen to experiences from different countries’ leaders in various fields and disciplines. She said that each of the awardees carry an important reminder in their respective topics and fields, whilst also noting the importance of different approaches and initiatives for a sustainable and inclusive economic development of ASEAN and Asia in general. She cited inclusiveness and sustainability as the main field to which people should not lose focus upon, and that she hoped to grow a community that would work together for a more sustainable and inclusive community.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:85:"/uploads/news/2022_may_head-and-heart-award-ceremony_800x450_page-0001-5-800_(3)1.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:13:"Anita Prakash";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:19805:"Nine Youthful Leaders Receive 2022 Head and Heart Award Nine Youthful Leaders Receive 2022 Head and Heart Award Jakarta/Singapore, 19 May 2022:&nbsp;Nine outstanding individuals from various countries who have made major contributions to their communities and countries in the fields of health, gender, equality, and youth empowerment were the latest recipients of the Leaders by Head and Heart Award, an annual award given by The Asian Network in partnership with the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).

Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, ERIA Director for Strategy and Partnership, gave introductory remarks and moderated the event.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">The roundtable gathered the views of five speakers from India and ASEAN:</p><ul style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px 20px; overflow: hidden; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;"><li style="padding: 0px;">Mr Chintan Bakshi, Partner - Incubation, CIIE.CO, India&nbsp;</li><li style="padding: 0px;">Mr Mudit Narain, Technology Officer, Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India&nbsp;</li><li style="padding: 0px;">Ms Michelle Ng, Senior Associate, Quest Ventures, Singapore</li><li style="padding: 0px;">Ms Mel Nava, CEO, 1 Export, Philippines&nbsp;</li><li style="padding: 0px;">Dr Chintan Vaishnav,&nbsp;Mission Director, Atal Innovation Mission, India</li></ul><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">During the discussion, the five speakers detailed the emerging features of the innovation ecosystem across India and ASEAN. In India, innovation ecosystems are diverse depending on local conditions, but common characteristics include the acceleration of start-up creation and scale-ups since the late 2000s, followed by growing policy support of accelerator programmes as a means of economic development and job creation from State Governments in India from around 2015 according to Mr Chintan Bakshi. He also explained that as the Indian innovation ecosystem is maturing, support to start-ups is becoming more targeted with the development of sectoral incubators and accelerators able to provide ad hoc services to different types of entrepreneurs in specific sectors.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Mr Mudit Narain explained how incubators should support start-ups at different stages of their entrepreneurial journeys from early on to more advanced stages. He also highlighted how incubator programmes are now mainstreamed across policies from at least eight Ministries in India, thanks to the initial efforts and impact metrics developed by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">The discussion also touched upon the importance of horizontal coordination across different policy actors under different ministries. As innovation is a cross-cutting issue, it is important to identify the challenges and opportunities of promoting more collaboration between business and academia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance for entrepreneurs to know the needs of the customers they want to serve was highlighted by Dr Chintan Vaishnav.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Ms Mel Nava described her experience as an entrepreneur in the Philippines, a dynamic location where venture funding is not yet available at the same level as in other Asian countries.&nbsp; Ms Nava highlighted the importance of incubator and accelerator programmes, especially to provide mentoring and networking opportunities to young entrepreneurs. She also mentioned how entrepreneurs need to know what problem they are trying to solve with their business to remain relevant.</p><div class="video-container" style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 450px; padding-top: 0px; height: 0px; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZamqaep6PM?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;controls=2" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" style="vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 800px; height: 450px;"></iframe></div>";s:10:"image_name";s:37:"/uploads/events/logo61baf6a7e7415.jpg";s:9:"video_url";s:28:"https://youtu.be/wZamqaep6PM";s:4:"tags";N;s:6:"editor";s:15:"Aladdin D Rillo";s:6:"author";N;s:6:"doc_no";N;s:6:"period";N;s:14:"article_status";N;s:10:"event_time";N;s:5:"venue";N;s:5:"major";N;s:16:"article_keywords";N;s:9:"organizer";N;s:12:"image_name_2";N;s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";N;s:9:"published";s:1:"1";s:9:"highlight";s:1:"0";s:8:"order_id";s:3:"100";s:12:"created_date";N;s:13:"modified_date";s:19:"2021-12-16 17:19:51";s:11:"modified_by";s:1:"1";s:7:"old_url";N;s:10:"majorEmail";N;s:9:"education";N;s:10:"experience";N;s:12:"publications";N;s:6:"others";N;s:13:"presentations";N;s:7:"feature";N;s:11:"sub_experts";s:1:"6";s:15:"sub_dep_experts";N;s:13:"meta_keywords";N;s:16:"meta_description";N;s:5:"sc_id";s:1:"0";}i:45;O:8:"stdClass":46:{s:9:"short_des";N;s:10:"article_id";s:4:"7337";s:12:"article_type";s:10:"multimedia";s:3:"uri";s:70:"Preventive-Diplomacy-with-Prof-Akiko-Yamanaka---ASEAN-Insights-Podcast";s:8:"pub_type";s:1:"0";s:5:"title";s:70:"Preventive Diplomacy with Prof Akiko Yamanaka | ASEAN Insights Podcast";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2022-06-20";s:11:"posted_year";s:1:"0";s:12:"posted_month";s:1:"0";s:7:"content";s:655:"<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">In this episode of ASEAN Insights, Prof Akiko Yamanaka; Special Advisor to ERIA’s President, Former Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Special Ambassador for Peacebuilding, Japan, discusses the Power of Preventative Diplomacy with Lydia Ruddy, ERIA’s Director of Communications and Special Advisor for US-ASEAN Affairs.

While expectations are high about the expected benefits of tariff elimination, they depend on compliance with a key component of the agreement: the rules of origin (ROO) chapter. ROO determine the origin of goods and whether they are eligible for preferential tariff treatment or not.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Co-organized by ERIA’s Capacity Building Programme and the Ministry of Commerce, Cambodia, this second Public-Private Dialogue <em>‘Unpacking the RCEP Agreement</em>: <em>The Rules of Origin (ROO) Provisions and What They Mean for Cambodia’</em> was held online on February 10th.  With over 110 participants including trade experts and members of the public and private sectors, the webinar discussed key strategies to unlock the full potential of RCEP by understanding the rules of origin.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">The webinar was opened by H.E. SIM Sokheng, Secretary of State, Ministry of Commerce (MoC), who highlighted the importance of public awareness about the ROO chapter.  The MOC has been pro-active in its own effort to disseminate information about the benefits of RCEP through multiple media. He noted how ROO is crucial for Cambodian businesses as it will leverage their export activity and bring more investment to Cambodia, thus contributing significantly to domestic economic growth. He further mentioned how the government is active in providing assistance and guidance to Cambodian businesses wishing to understand procedures around RCEP ROO.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">The first session, moderated by Sven Callebaut, International Trade Consultant, focused on the importance of ROO. Dr Deborah Elms, Executive Director of the Asian Trade Centre, explained the general benefits and challenges of RCEP and the rules that need to be applied to access these benefits. She gave examples from the food and textile sectors including goods which are and are not eligible to benefit from ROO’s two main principles: ‘wholly obtained goods’ and ‘substantial transformation.’</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">The discussion continued with Mr UN Chantha, Director of Export Import Department, Ministry of Commerce, who shared his observation on how the ROO applies to Cambodian-made products before and after the RCEP agreement. He highlighted key improvements of ROO under RCEP which include streamlining the operational certification procedure and having greater regional cumulation. Lastly, he noted efforts to train Cambodian officials are underway to support the business sector and inform them of the opportunities created by RCEP ROO.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">The second session focused on the private sector’s perspectives on opportunities. Mr Clint O’Connell, Partner and Head of Tax and Customs, DFDL, Cambodia, discussed the importance for businesses and investors to understand ROO for unlocking the benefits. He explained that generally there is already a good level of understanding about ROO in some sectors whilst further outreach is needed for others, and to MSMEs in particular.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Mr Robin Flint, First Secretary at the Australian Embassy in Cambodia, continued the discussion by sharing his perspective of the RCEP’s rationale dynamics to support the global value chain through a set of tariff preferences. He highlighted the pivotal engagement between businesses and governments to tap RCEP potential, for instance the establishment of the single portal and business guide.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3dIcjmD20A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">H.E.

In his opening remarks, Mr Tay highlighted the historical development of the ASEAN Smart City Network (ASCN), highlighting the enabling environment in Singapore as a Smart Nation.
Dr Anbumozhi, the main speaker, explained there are no clear guidelines for developing smart cities; each city has its own definition. Transforming cities into smart cities is key to providing &lsquo;intelligent solutions&rsquo; to the challenges of urbanization, said Dr Anbumozhi. Generally speaking, a &lsquo;smart city&rsquo; can be understood as a city that has improved facilities and services in order to deal with urbanization challenges including energy, mobility, ICT, waste and wastewater management, and emissions reduction.
The ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) includes six components common to smart city development: (a) smart governance, (b) smart living, (c) smart economy, (d) smart people, (e) smart environment, and (f) smart mobility.&nbsp; ICT, data management and the Internet of Things (IoT) also play essential roles to enable a smart city environment. Learning from Singapore, the cities of Chiang Mai, Johor Bahru and Jakarta, have employed a common but differentiated technology roadmap to achieve smart city goals.
In terms of financing smart cities, Dr Anbumozhi suggested that collaboration amongst stakeholders is crucial. City governments have budget allocations for city improvement that can be used for smart city development. Meanwhile, community funding, such as crowdfunding may be tapped to fund development. However city governments need to coordinate policies and decisions with other levels of national governments.&nbsp; In addition to that, Mr Tay suggested that Public-Private Partnership (PPP) should be considered as well.
The preliminary conclusion of this research study covers three points: there is an opportunity in ASEAN for a paradigm shift towards sustainable cities, technology development is critical for infrastructure and service delivery, and incorporation of digital intelligence, digital inclusion and innovation networks into strategic planning of ASEAN Smart cities models is important.

The main messages that emerged from the discussion included:

The adoption of E-commerce is an opportunity for ASEAN MSMEs to attract more global customers and to increase profitability. However, the borderless world of e-commerce platforms also means greater competition, therefore MSMEs need to find their niche to be successful.
The importance of strategy development combined with new skill-sets for MSMEs to thrive and remain competitive
The importance of effective digital data analysis to anticipate future trends and attract new customers, especially in a region where granular data is particularly difficult to obtain in some countries.
The importance of local government support (tax, public-private partnership schemes, competition policy, loans, etc) to promote e-commerce and digitalisation.

The webinar was hosted and moderated by Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, ERIA&rsquo;s Director of the Strategy and Partnership Programme. She opened the session by sharing some key points from ERIA&rsquo;s research:

ASEAN is one of the fastest-growing digital economies in the world
Indonesia&rsquo;s e-commerce market has grown at a rate of over 30% per year
The e-commerce market is projected to experience double-digit growth in Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia
Digital consumers in ASEAN had grown significantly from 90 million in 2015 to 250 million in 2018, according to a recent analysis by Facebook and Bain.

Mel Nava, Founder of 1Export based in the Philippines, pointed out that e-commerce had been a game-changer for her business in connecting local goods from the Philippines with several customers in other regions for export. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, her sales increased by 400%. She highlighted the importance&nbsp;of embracing e-commerce for MSMEs as part of their business strategy.
Mr John Amos Tan, Founder and Principal Trainer of Cutting Edge Learning Hub in Singapore, shared his observations on the increase in e-commerce adoption as a result of the pandemic. However, he also noted that consumers had become more demanding, and pressures on pricing had also increased during this period. This led to his conclusion that with e-commerce adoption, for MSMEs to gain a competitive edge they should also focus on improving overall customer experiences.

Such decarbonisation means an additional investment is necessary. Nevertheless, the question remains: how to finance the energy transition, especially in the context of reaching carbon neutrality pledges that vary across G20 countries?</span></p><p data-key="94" style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;"><span data-key="95">Apart from traditional financial and policy instruments, countries need also to fully employ new and innovative schemes to support clean energy financing and markets.

Ten eminent energy and economy experts, government officials and academics shared their insights on possible challenges and opportunities that the ASEAN region will face in order to secure energy supply and demand as well as its affordability.</p><p>During his opening remarks, Prof Jun Arima, ERIA Senior Policy Fellow for Energy and Environment, emphasized how the unprecedented situation of COVID-19 has pushed countries into an economic recession and has delayed many countries&rsquo; climate agendas. Lower fossil fuel prices during the pandemic will delay efforts to support an energy transition to clean and renewable energy due to their higher price compared to fossil fuels. Green economy schemes, including the energy resources, have been suggested by international fora such as the United Nations, the International Energy Agency, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Prof Jun Arima then moderated throughout the workshop.</p><p>Second opening remarks were delivered by Dr Ken Koyama, Chief Economist and Managing Director at the IEEJ. He pointed out that the region has faced challenges on energy and environment for many years which are now exacerbated by COVID-19. To some extent, lower prices of oil could be good news for developing countries, however they could jeopardize future sustainability. Moreover, not only issues on energy supply and demand, geopolitics and digitalization should be taken into account. Digitalization may significantly increase demand for electricity, making it all the more important to secure energy stability including its supply, price, and sustainability.</p><p>The first speaker was Dr Han Phoumin, ERIA Energy Economist, who highlighted that some ASEAN countries are already facing challenges of increasing national debts and depleted national savings in order to protect the national economic situation from the impact of COVID-19. In terms of energy security, he is suggested promoting the use of natural gas as a transitional fuel in ASEAN, without putting aside accelerating the use of renewables and energy efficiency for medium to long-term development. Furthermore, the declining price of fossil fuel should be taken as an opportunity for ASEAN leaders to reform energy policy such as fossil fuel subsidies and green stimulus packages to create long-lasting impacts in lowering emissions.</p><p>The second speaker was Dr Ken Koyama from IEEJ, who addressed two main points. First, the lower price of fossil fuels should help ASEAN prepare for future energy instability. He suggested that investing in energy is a must and that the investments should also cover low carbon energy systems. Secondly, the pandemic might cause an energy revolution, for example reduction in transportation usage, changes in lifestyle which impact energy supply and demand, and digitalization that could reduce future mobility. After COVID-19, climate change and decarbonization issues will continue to be important challenges, however, human survival, the economy, and health will be the sectors needing immediate actions to achieve recovery.</p><p>The third speaker was Dr Nuky Agya Utama from the ASEAN Center for Energy (ACE) who said that lower energy demand has caused power plants and the utility companies to adjust various factors to stabilize supply and demand within the ASEAN region. The region needs to consider focusing on energy security and affordability which requires intersectoral cooperation. Also, this is an opportunity to increase renewable energy in the overall primary energy supply. In the long run, renewable energy will be increasingly competitive to support energy security within the region.</p><p>The fourth speaker was Dr Twarath Sutabutr, Inspector-General at the Ministry of Energy, Thailand. Dr Sutabutr highlighted several points regarding energy security and recovery plans for the post COVID-19 situation in Thailand. During the pandemic, Thailand imported LNG to secure the energy supply. Also, connectivity with neighboring countries allowed Thailand to import electricity from neighbors as well as export it to Myanmar due to the increase power demand at the Myanmar border. For the recovery plan, there are two points of policy actions: first, recovery efforts on four main sectors: tourism, health care, food, and global supply chain. Second, new business investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, providing for an energy transition to low carbon technology.</p><p>The last speaker was Dr Saleh Abdurrahman, Special Adviser for the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, who explained the Indonesian energy situation during pandemic. He said that around 60% of manufacturing industries were hit hard by the pandemic, decreasing electricity and fuel consumption in the first quarter. However, starting from August, fuel consumption was nearly normal, especially in greater Jakarta, due to the &lsquo;new normal&rsquo; regulations. Domestic consumption, which is still relatively high, helped the economy to keep running. However, there are still several issues to address, such as increased international support regarding low carbon technology for ASEAN and developing countries, and how policy makers maintain climate issues as a priority during and after pandemic.</p><p>In closing, Shigeru Kimura, ERIA Special Advisor on Energy Affairs, delivered his remarks, mentioning that COVID-19 has wrought severe damage to the economy, including the energy sector. It creates uncertainty regarding countries&rsquo; development after COVD-19, including energy growth and CO2 emissions. The &lsquo;new normal&rsquo; promises the era of digitalization, but this might create new challenges for some ASEAN countries whose economies depend on manufacturing products or who have low internet penetration rates. Post COVID-19&rsquo;s economic recovery will be supported by huge government budgets, and energy consumption and CO2 emission will likely return to pre-pandemic levels. In this regard, governments need to pay attention and should consider allocating budgets to energy sector to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy penetration. Additionally, he emphasized key technologies that are important for ASEAN, such as a new generation of vehicle (Electric and Fuel-Cell Vehicle), CCUS/Carbon Cycling, and Hydrogen. &nbsp;</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:107:"/uploads/news/20200910/2020-september-eria-ieej-webinar-energy-situation-in-asean-post-covid-19_800x450.png";s:9:"video_url";s:0:"";s:4:"tags";s:0:"";s:6:"editor";s:0:"";s:6:"author";s:0:"";s:6:"doc_no";s:0:"";s:6:"period";s:0:"";s:14:"article_status";s:1:"0";s:10:"event_time";s:0:"";s:5:"venue";s:0:"";s:5:"major";s:0:"";s:16:"article_keywords";s:0:"";s:9:"organizer";s:0:"";s:12:"image_name_2";s:0:"";s:10:"start_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"end_date";s:10:"0000-00-00";s:8:"keywords";s:13483:"The Energy Situation in ASEAN Post COVID-19: An Online Workshop The Energy Situation in ASEAN Post COVID-19: An Online Workshop Jakarta, 10 September 2020: The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), in collaboration with the Institute of Energy Economics Japan (IEEJ), hosted an online workshop on the energy situation during and post COVID-19 in the ASEAN region.

<p>In this ASEAN Insights episode, Lydia Ruddy, ERIA&rsquo;s Director of Communications and Special Advisor for US-ASEAN Affairs, discusses with Yasu Ota, Tokyo-based columnist and TV commentator for Nikkei, on his best-selling book in Japan, &lsquo;2030 Geopolitics of Semiconductors&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the conversation, Yasu Ota shares his views on the role that artificial intelligence (AI) development is playing in the ongoing political tensions, Japan's place in the competition for semiconductor production, and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;how ASEAN can best position itself to take advantage of the current situation.</p>

The global health crisis has shed light on the extraordinary impact of female leadership and how empathy and compassion can be harnessed to become critical leadership skills. The multi-sectoral impact of the pandemic has nonetheless resulted in widening the gender equality gap. Across the Asia Pacific, women need to become increasingly recognised for their roles as leaders and agents of change.

The global health crisis has shed light on the extraordinary impact of female leadership and how empathy and compassion can be harnessed to become critical leadership skills. The multi-sectoral impact of the pandemic has nonetheless resulted in widening the gender equality gap. Across the Asia Pacific, women need to become increasingly recognised for their roles as leaders and agents of change. Governments, businesses, political bodies, and corporations have responded to the trend by improving gender parity, though with slow progress.
