This online interface called the Private Sector Platform (PSP) in short, hosts information submitted by private companies operating in all ASEAN+3 countries to showcase their products, services, or technologies contributing to the reduction of plastic waste and marine plastic debris. The platform collects and disseminates private companies&rsquo; business activities that are conducive to marine plastics mitigation. It also aims to encourage Business-to-Business, Business-to-Government and/or Business-to-Consumer opportunities in the ASEAN+3 region.</p><p>The forum will be an occasion for the Ministry of Environment of Cambodia, Cambodian business alliances, and Cambodian private companies to stocktake the progress made, and discuss the many ways private companies can contribute in combatting plastic waste and marine plastic debris.

The forum aimed to facilitate the exchange of information, knowledge, and best practices amongst ASEAN sectoral bodies; identify possible areas for synergy and collaboration across sectors; and recommend ways to advance the circular economy (CE) in the region. Insights from the dialogue will serve as inputs to the Implementation Plan for the Framework for Circular Economy for the ASEAN Economic Community and strengthen cross-sectoral work for a smooth transition to CE. The implementation plan is a follow-up to the Framework for Circular Economy for ASEAN Economic Community adopted in November 2021.</p><p>The dialogue focused on agriculture, energy, and transport. Each session discussed possible short-, medium-, and long-term initiatives, and identified the challenges and barriers for ASEAN in transitioning to CE. The outcomes of the sessions highlighted the three key common enablers for circularity in ASEAN: funding, institutional coordination, and regulations to support the transition to CE.</p><p>The revised draft of the implementation plan will be submitted to the Senior Economic Officials Meeting in August 2022, and the final version to the ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting in September 2022.</p>";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2022-07-19";s:12:"article_type";s:4:"news";}i:2;a:5:{s:3:"uri";s:66:"asean-japan-business-week-toward-innovative-and-sustainable-growth";s:5:"title";s:67:"ASEAN-Japan Business Week: Toward Innovative and Sustainable Growth";s:7:"content";s:10502:"<p><strong>Tokyo, 24 May 2021:</strong> Southeast Asia has always been at the heart of the international business for many Japanese companies, and it has become even more important for them to respond flexibly and rapidly to the massive transformations caused by transformations such as digitalisation and green growth in the region.<br /> <br /> The &#039;ASEAN-Japan Business Week&#039;, a brand-new online event hosted by multiple organisations from ASEAN and Japan, provided an opportunity to better understand the latest trends around the business in ASEAN and the potentials in the future. The five-day event was officially started on Monday, 24 May 2021 and streamed by more than 200 participants. Mr Koji Hachiyama, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of ERIA and Dr Han Phoumin, Senior Economist of ERIA attended the event as the speakers.</p><p>The opening session was divided into two sessions with different topics: first, Establishing New Partnerships between Japan and Southeast Asia, with the following speakers giving their remarks:</p><ol><li>H. E. Kajiyama Hiroshi (Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Japan)</li><li>H.E. Dato Lim Jock Hoi (Secretary-General of ASEAN)</li><li>Sasaki Nobuhiko (Chief Executive Officer of JETRO)</li><li>Mimura Akio (Chairman, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI))</li><li>Hara Noriyuki (Chair, Committee on Asia and Oceania, Keidanren Representative Director, Chairman of the Board, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd)</li><li>Tamura Akihiko (Director-General for Trade Policy of Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Japan)</li></ol><p>The speakers highlighted the importance of digitalisation, especially in the time of the pandemic. The digital transformation is rapidly accelerating in the ASEAN region. Therefore, taking advantage of this, Japan-ASEAN partnership can be strengthened to promote green growth.</p><p>Digitalisation and sustainability are critical to the recovery efforts in the next phase of economic integration. ASEAN has set a digital agenda through the ASEAN Digital Integration Framework Action Plan 2025. On sustainability and green growth, ASEAN has been continuously promoting financing of the ASEAN Green/Sustainability Bond Standards, as well as developing a roadmap for a sustainable capital market. These actions need support from all stakeholders in the region including the business community, as well as Japanese community.</p><p>ASEAN has also launched the Comprehensive Recovery Framework to promote programs and policies that will support a strong and resilient post-pandemic economy.&nbsp; JETRO JICA actively supports members companies of small-medium enterprises (SMEs) in a number of ways, including by providing the consultation desk. Promoting economic recovery and society 5.0 for sustainable development goals are also on the agenda.</p><p>There are three important elements to the ASEAN-Japan relationship: 1) strengthening ASEAN connectivity; 2) promoting the social development of digital technology; and 3) supporting sustainable growth (global agenda of climate change, environment, and decarbonisation).</p><p>The third session addressed Transforming Southeast Asia, Transforming Japanese Business.</p><p>During this session, the speakers emphasised the impact of COVID-19 across the region and the multiple challenges and opportunities that can develop as part of recovery including the circular economy and green growth. Digitalisation is developing very quickly, triggering the supply chain revolution. Most of the offline businesses are taking the advantages to expand their businesses to online platforms in order to survive (e-payment, telemedicine, fintech, agriculture, and fisheries). SMEs need support to adopt digital technology, otherwise, they are going to collapse. Digitalisation can also bring Japan to the Southeast Asia market.</p><p><a title="Watch the video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tPgWpfgzNY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr Koji Hachiyama, COO of ERIA, spoke on this panel</a>. &nbsp;He opened his presentation by giving an overview of the ASEAN economic situation. According to Mr Hachiyama, ASEAN has contained the impact from COVID-19 and is expected to continue to have high growth after COVID-19. Businesses in ASEAN will also continue to grow dynamically while responding to the situation caused by COVID-19.</p><p>On digitalisation, he explained that ASEAN has a high potential for digitalisation as it is progressing rapidly. ASEAN will become a huge digital single market and will be a major player in the world economy in the future. On the other hand, there are still many problems, such as the security measures which are not catching up with rapid digitalisation. However, this situation will give many business opportunities as well. In ASEAN, digitalisation is in the rapid transition stage from &lsquo;Line activities&rsquo; (electronic commerce, etc.) to &lsquo;Area activities&rsquo; (data free flow and common data platform, digital transformation). Japanese technology could contribute positively to the digitalisation in ASEAN.</p><p>He also addressed the issue of the circular economy, which prioritises material recovery at the end of a product lifecycle to bring resources back into the production process and eliminate waste, such as in smart cities and recycling. Mr Hachiyama highlighted six principles for advancing the circular economy in ASEAN:</p><ol><li>Creating a concept under the international production network</li><li>Contributing to the promotion of ASEAN economic integration</li><li>Sufficiently assessing the impact on production costs and market prices, especially in SMEs</li><li>Raising awareness and recognizing that the circular economy will contribute to long-term growth</li><li>Promoting efforts that respect the ASEAN Way, such as coordination for the entire ASEAN</li><li>Ensuring financial sustainability and feasibility before proceeding with business</li></ol><p>He said that with their advanced technologies, Japanese companies can become more involved and grow significantly together with ASEAN.</p><p>On the third day, ERIA Senior Energy Economist, Dr Han Phoumin, <a title="Watch the video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlT9RivPxx0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">provided a keynote speech entitled &lsquo;Decarbonisation Scenarios for ASEAN: Methodology and Expected Results&rsquo;</a> during the session on &lsquo;Promoting Green Business for Sustainable Development in Southeast Asia&rsquo;. Dr Han started off with the key message that the ASEAN faces tremendous challenges in the race to carbon neutrality &lsquo;net zero emissions&rsquo; by the middle of the 21st century regarding the future energy landscape and how the energy transition will embrace a new architecture &ndash; including sound policies and technologies to ensure energy access together with affordability, energy security, and energy sustainability. Given the high share of fossil fuels in ASEAN&rsquo;s current energy mix (oil, coal, and natural gas comprise almost 80%), the clean use of fossil fuels through the deployment of clean technologies is indispensable for decarbonising ASEAN&rsquo;s emissions.</p><p>He also highlighted the fact that ASEAN is rich in solar resources, however only a few countries have offshore wind resources such as Viet Nam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Mainland Southeast Asia - &lsquo;the Mekong subregion&rsquo;- &nbsp;countries are rich of hydropower. Increasing the penetration of solar and wind could be facilitated by future power connectivity and trade within ASEAN. If the ASEAN electricity market gradually moves up to a multilateral/integrated electricity market, the hydropower resource from the Mekong subregion could play a significant role as the baseload power which can complement the high penetration of solar and wind energy. In the absence of a thermal power plant, a large capacity of electrical battery storage is necessary as power backup during days of less sunshine and wind. &nbsp;</p><p>The high penetration of variable renewable energy (solar and wind); the clean energy of hydrogen fuel; and carbon sink technology such as carbon capture sequestration utilisation and storage (CCUS) will become the future energy mix in massive scale, but only when the carbon price can be regulated. In the carbonisation scenarios of his presentation for ASEAN&rsquo;s case, the marginal abatement cost of decarbonisation could reach $700 US/tCO2 if the target of net zero emission is set at 2070. However, if the net zero emission target is set by 2050, the marginal abatement cost could skyrocket to $955US/tCO2.</p><p>Dr Phoumin also shared his view that such &nbsp;high-cost scenarios of decarbonisation may present challenges for the energy transition in ASEAN. However, CCUS is a promising technology in cost competitiveness for the foreseeable future. Managing the energy transition in ASEAN towards clean energy systems and carbon neutrality will need to consider the presence of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) in the short- and medium-term energy system. It will be crucial to explore ways to use fossil fuels in an environmentally sustainable manner to act as a bridge to a carbon-free energy future. For successful implementation of the energy transition and climate change policy objectives, policymakers will need to balance other equally important policy objectives of energy security, energy access, and affordability.</p><p>Further, ASEAN will need to set clear targets and actions in all sectors and programmes to facilitate the penetration of renewables, clean technologies, and clean energy to decarbonise ASEAN&rsquo;s emission. Appropriate financing instrument will need to be designed to support such up-take of clean technologies, clean fuels, and renewables. This presentation provided a roadmap of ASEAN&rsquo;s decarbonisation scenarios and gave attention to ASEAN&rsquo;s leaders, policy makers and stakeholders on how ASEAN will need to tackle emissions.</p><p>The race to carbon neutrality and net zero emissions of ASEAN will rely on today&rsquo;s actions, policies, and investments to change the fossil fuel-based energy system towards a cleaner energy system, but any decisions and energy policy measures to be rolled out during the energy transition need to be weighed against potentially higher energy costs, affordability issues, and energy security risks.</p>";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2021-05-24";s:12:"article_type";s:10:"multimedia";}i:3;a:5:{s:3:"uri";s:48:"the-experts-roundtable-on-asean-circular-economy";s:5:"title";s:56:"The Expertsâ€™ Roundtable on ASEAN Circular Economy";s:7:"content";s:0:"";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2021-04-14";s:12:"article_type";s:6:"events";}i:4;a:5:{s:3:"uri";s:87:"eria-holds-webinar-on-sustainability-practices-for-msmes-in-a-covid-19-world-and-beyond";s:5:"title";s:87:"ERIA Holds Webinar on Sustainability Practices for MSMEs in a COVID-19 World and Beyond";s:7:"content";s:5432:"<p><strong>Jakarta, 24 September 2020</strong>: ERIA hosted the<em>&nbsp;MSMEs Talk #5- Sustainability Practices for MSMEs in a COVID-19 World and Beyond.&nbsp;</em>This webinar concluded the first part of the MSMEs series organized under ERIA&rsquo;s Strategy and Partnership Programme, funded by Australia. The webinar was held on the 24th of September 2020 and attracted more than 190 participants from the Asia-Pacific region.&nbsp;</p><p>In her opening remarks, Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, ERIA&rsquo;s Director of Strategy and Partnership, emphasized the increased recognition of the need to apply sustainability practices in ASEAN across a broad range of stakeholders. She also highlighted the crucial roles that the private sector &ndash; both larger firms and MSMEs - has to play to adopt and develop sustainability practices to provide a better future.</p><p>Four speakers participated in the webinar:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Aivonne Chong, Founder &amp; Managing Director, Brown Bag Wines (Singapore)</li><li>Priyanka Chetry, CEO, Grocerdel (Cambodia)</li><li>Venkatachalam Anbumozhi, Senior Energy Economist, ERIA</li><li>Jootae Kim, Professor, Dankook University, Korea</li></ul><p>&nbsp;The main messages arising from the discussion were:</p><ul><li>MSMEs need to think holistically and in a multi-dimensional way when developing sustainability practices: environmental, human, social, and economic sustainability;</li><li>The importance of business-led initiatives to promote actions for the circular economy to make economic models both economic and environmentally sound and sustainable;</li><li>Digitalization, technology, and innovation play an essential role in leveraging the adoption and promotion of sustainability practices in business sectors.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Ms Chong highlighted the importance of applying a holistic and sustainable approach to a range of practices from business models to products and services. She also noted that the businesses can be change-makers to promote better sustainable development.&nbsp;Ms Chong also explained how her sustainable business has grown considerably during the pandemic, as customers started to pay more attention to environmentally sustainable practices.</p><p>Ms Chetry highlighted the importance of raising the awareness of sustainability across the entire production chain: from the employee to the vendor, and to the customers. Using the example of her own company, she explained how employees, vendors, and customers are satisfied when they know how they contribute to plastic reduction efforts embedded in the business model of her company. She also noted the importance of innovation in implementing better sustainability practices for a better future.&nbsp;</p><p>Prof Kim highlighted the importance of integrating green business models as part of the development of MSMEs. Technological advances are important to scale up green tech adoption.&nbsp; He mentioned that there is a growing attention to this topic in Korea and the Korean government is supporting MSMEs to adopt green technologies via a new policy called the &#039;Green New Deal&#039;.</p><p>Dr Anbumozhi explained how MSMEs are part of the socio-economic fabric and play an important role to promote sustainability. MSMEs can operate in different contexts: in clusters, as part of global value chains, or predominantly in domestic markets. Depending on these characteristics the way they can &lsquo;go green&rsquo; may differ. He also highlighted the importance of the circular economy framework to move from a linear economic model to a circular one. Dr Anbumozhi mentioned the important role that the private sector has to play in the development of ASEAN smart cities. However, he also mentioned some of the challenges that exist for MSMEs to become greener, in particular, access to finance is critical for MSMEs. In many cases, the banking sector is not ready to finance green innovations. There is an opportunity for city governments, through smart city development, to develop new financial instruments to support the green transition.</p><p>During the Q&amp;A session, themes that emerged included: (i) the increasing role of the MSMEs to define sustainability in a broad way that includes practices protecting the environment, reinvigorating the local economy, and fostering social inclusion&nbsp; (ii) the emerging trend for potential business sectors to adopt shared sustainability values (ii) the adoption of circular business models.</p><h2>Related Publications</h2><ul><li><a title="[Policy Brief] Implications of the COVID-19 Crisis for the Energy Sector and Climate Change in ASEAN" href="/database-and-programmes/policy-brief-implications-of-the-covid-19-crisis-for-the-energy-sector-and-climate-change-in-asean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Policy Brief] Implications of the COVID-19 Crisis for the Energy Sector and Climate Change in ASEAN</a></li><li><a title="Industry 4.0: Empowering ASEAN for the Circular Economy&nbsp;" href="/research/industry-40-empowering-asean-for-the-circular-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Industry 4.0: Empowering ASEAN for the Circular Economy&nbsp;</a></li><li><a title="Enhancing the Readiness of ASEAN Smart Cities&nbsp;" href="/database-and-programmes/enhancing-the-readiness-of-asean-smart-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancing the Readiness of ASEAN Smart Cities&nbsp;</a></li></ul>";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2020-09-24";s:12:"article_type";s:10:"multimedia";}i:5;a:5:{s:3:"uri";s:105:"eria-unescap-joint-virtual-policy-dialogue-on-the-economic-and-social-survey-of-asia-and-the-pacific-2020";s:5:"title";s:115:"ERIA â€“UNESCAP Joint Virtual Policy Dialogue on 'The Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2020'";s:7:"content";s:7046:"<p><strong>Jakarta, 10 June 2020:</strong> The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) and the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) held a joint virtual policy dialogue on <a href="https://www.unescap.org/publications/economic-and-social-survey-asia-and-pacific-2020"><em>The Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2020: Towards Sustainable Economies</em></a>. The dialogue brought perspectives of policy experts as well as public opinion on how to rethink development models in the post COVID-19 world. The economic challenge for the region is bringing the region on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 while coming to terms with the COVID-19&rsquo;s &lsquo;new normal&rsquo;.</p><p>The policy dialogue event began with an Opening Remark by ERIA&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer, Mr Koji Hachiyama while ERIA&rsquo;s Senior Energy Economist, Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi moderated the discussions.</p><p>In his 0pening remark, Mr Hachiyama highlighted that the transformation of regional development in the Asia-Pacific region has lifted a billion people from extreme poverty. However, Mr Hachiyama was quick to point out that the development has come at a cost to people and the planet as the world faces a growing number of climate-related disasters and changes. Immediate actions are needed from all stakeholders &ndash; governments, businesses, and consumers &ndash; to build a &lsquo;whole-of-government&rsquo; and a &lsquo;whole-of-society&rsquo; approach to strive for a sustainable mindset in policymaking, business models, and lifestyles. Expressing his views on the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Hachiyama stated that partnership is key to building resilience and cooperation across borders. Cooperating on areas such as information sharing, open trade, policy coordination, and capacity building can support a sustainable recovery post-COVID-19.</p><p>In the first session, Mr. Zheng Jian, UNESCAP&rsquo;s policy expert, highlighted the overall focus of the 2020 survey - the transformation towards sustainable economies &ndash; which is a primary policy challenge for the Asia-Pacific region. Paradigm shifts towards greener and less material-intensive production and consumption, as articulated in SDG 12, are at the centre of this transformation and require collective efforts of all stakeholders &ndash; governments, businesses, consumers and global partnerships.&nbsp; Governments need to embed sustainability in their policymaking and provide leadership and guidance in decarbonizing the economy. Businesses and consumers can also make their own important contributions in internalizing the environmental externalities of business operations and in moving towards sustainable lifestyles.</p><p>Last but not least, cross-border cooperation for policy harmonization and coordinated multilateral effort would be important to reduce frictions, prevent inaction and raise ambitions. Reflecting on the current COVID-19 crisis, Mr. Jian argued that it brought both new challenges and new hopes for inclusive and sustainable development, as putting people and jobs first is becoming a broad policy consensus and the crisis itself is a clear reminder that non-economic shocks could have devastating economic impacts. He thus advocated for a deviation from the GDP-centric development thinking to turn the crisis into an opportunity for further integrating the economic, social and environmental pillars and enhancing public awareness of the risk and cost of inaction or delayed action in the transformation towards sustainable economies.</p><p>&nbsp;Speaking next, Dr Anbumozhi explained how implementing a circular economy aligned to an Industry 4.0 framework would support a paradigm shift in consumption and production.</p><p>In the following session, sharing ERIA&rsquo;s ongoing studies, Dr Anbumozhi emphasized the need to develop integrated circular economy and Industry 4.0 frameworks, for effectively supporting the paradigm shift towards sustainable consumption and production.&nbsp; To do so requires mobilizing private finance in support of new sustainability models.</p><p>Dr Anbumozhi additionally shared his thoughts on a Green economic stimulus response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the &lsquo;No Regrets Option&rsquo; framework, Dr Anbumozhi underlined how principles for green stimulus, such as sustainable growth and market-based solutions, can be realized under different timeframes. Furthermore, he called for the need to address emergency containment measures, the transition into the new normal, and planning long-term strategies for the Southeast Asian region.</p><p>Event speakers, Professor Arief Anshory Yusuf from Padjajaran University, Indonesia, and Dr. Qwanruedee Chotichanathawewong from National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT)shared their insights on the actual situations in Indonesia and Thailand amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>In the context of Indonesia, Prof Yusuf recommended incorporating COVID-19 scenarios into the Indonesian economic growth measurement to minimize long-term economic loss. Responding to UNESCAP Report&rsquo;s recommendation to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, Prof Yusuf elaborated on how fuel subsidy reforms since 2002 have been insufficient in accomplishing the government&rsquo;s objectives. Factors such as fluctuating global oil prices, strong political influences, and lack of social safety nets influenced the lacklustre success of meeting the intended goal.</p><p>For Thailand, Dr Chotichanathawewong explained the government&rsquo;s existing programs on social inclusion encompassing the launch of the National Savings Fund, multi-year public infrastructure projects, and the registration of low-income households. These economic reforms are aimed at improving SDG12 and if successful, will advance Thailand&rsquo;s efforts to achieve other SDGs.</p><p>To close the event, panellists answered questions regarding low-carbon development strategies in ASEAN post-COVID-19 as well as the costs and benefits of a carbon tax and carbon pricing for ASEAN Member-States.</p><p class="pdf"><a title="ERIA-UNESCAP - Mr Zheng Jian" href="/uploads/media/!ERIA-UNESCAP---Mr-Zheng-Jian.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERIA-UNESCAP - Mr Zheng Jian</a></p><p class="pdf"><a title="ERIA-UNESCAP - Prof Arief Anshori" href="/uploads/media/!ERIA-UNESCAP---Prof-Arief-Anshori.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERIA-UNESCAP - Prof Arief Anshori</a></p><p class="pdf"><a title="ERIA-UNESCAP - Dr Qwanruedee Chotichanathawewong" href="/uploads/media/!ERIA-UNESCAP---Dr-QwanruedeeChotichanathawewong.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERIA-UNESCAP - Dr Qwanruedee Chotichanathawewong</a></p><p class="pdf"><a title="ERIA-UNESCAP - Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi" href="/uploads/media/!ERIA-UNESCAP---Dr-Venkatachalam-Anbumozhi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERIA-UNESCAP - Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi</a></p>";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2020-06-10";s:12:"article_type";s:4:"news";}i:6;a:5:{s:3:"uri";s:59:"from-containment-to-recovery-rescuing-the-asean-from-crisis";s:5:"title";s:61:"From Containment to Recovery:  Rescuing the ASEAN from Crisis";s:7:"content";s:7472:"<p><strong>By Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi, Senior Energy Economist:&nbsp;</strong>The upcoming 36th ASEAN Summit will take place against the backdrop of severely damaged business and investor confidence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Containing and mitigating the spread of the pandemic is the current priority of all ASEAN member states, with concerted efforts to shore up public health systems.</p><p>As countries around the world debate how quickly they should reopen their economies from the lockdown, some ASEAN countries like Vietnam are largely ahead of the curve. A nationwide social distancing campaign that shut down non-essential businesses ended on April 22 in Vietnam, and life has returned to striking normalcy within a month, with reported coronavirus infections in that period.</p><p>Domestic tourism is slowly picking up, as authorities ease social distancing regulations on planes, trains, and buses. As a result of decisive actions on timely travel bans, cluster testing, and prolonged quarantines, Vietnam has only seen a tiny number of confirmed infections. In early April, the Vietnamese government also announced a $2.6 billion relief package aimed at 20 million people, which included cash transfers to those considered poor and vulnerable.</p><p>Similar containment and recovery strategies are being followed by other ASEAN member countries, as they are unveiling economic stimulus packages of unprecedented size, scale, and scope. They also realised that the pandemic is an economic challenge of much greater gravity than the 1997 and 2008 financial crises.</p><p>While individual countries are making strenuous efforts to successfully contain the pandemic, there are serious flaws in the international co-operation strategy to deal with the crisis. Since the discovery of COVID-19 in December, countries have acted in almost complete isolation from one another.</p><p>Only on March 25 did the United Nations launch a $2 billion global response plan to fund the fight against the pandemic. It is unclear how the ASEAN as a block endorsed it or benefited from it. On April 14, the ASEAN+3 leaders meeting committed to establishing an ASEAN COVID-19 Response Fund, but the details and composition of the contributions are not yet detailed.</p><p>Global financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank do have economic co-operation instruments but they are often accompanied by restrictive bilateral conditions to be dealt by the countries individually. It is a hope that more globally co-ordinated action by the G20 will be undertaken as more COVID-19 containment strategies become successful.</p><p>The onset and offset of the global health crisis containment measures like lockdowns, social distancing, international air travel bans, and limiting freight transport are being enacted based on contagion rates of individual ASEAN countries and their capacity of healthcare infrastructure. The announced unemployment subsidies vary from country to country depending upon their fiscal space, while migrant labourers from heavily-infected countries are banned from travelling.</p><p>In the last two months, epidemic walls replaced physical walls of the ASEAN member states. Such scenarios would represent the collapse of the &#039;One community, one response&#039; vision. Given the nature of the epidemic, developmental stages and infrastructure gaps, adaption of these country-specific measures is understandable.</p><p>However, it is myopic, unsustainable, and potentially counterproductive. The current lack of co-ordinated action at both regional and global level is not only concerning, but also surprising. If the virus is not eradicated in every country, every country will lose because sooner or later the disease will reappear and thus continues the prolonged economic meltdown. An economic crisis caused by a virus that ignores borders cannot be tackled successfully like this.</p><p>The ASEAN can defeat this invisible adversary and lessen the adverse economic impacts, but only with strong regionally co-ordinated actions and strong leadership. To succeed, the forthcoming ASEAN Summit needs to achieve at least three important goals.</p><p>First, ASEAN leaders must show that they can work together to implement co-ordinated regional plans announced during the Special Summit held on April 14.</p><p>Second, a concrete action that can help the ASEAN show leadership in stimulating the global economy is to roll back the trade restrictions imposed during the pandemic and conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Experience in the past three years shows that tariffs can slow global economic growth. On the other hand, concluding RCEP negotiations will help revive business confidence and stimulate growth &ndash; a needed shot in the arm for the global economy at this juncture of the pandemic.</p><p>Last but not least, ASEAN leaders need to offer a co-ordinated and synchronised fiscal stimulation plan, substantially bigger than what the 10 countries have already announced in an uncoordinated way, making them less impactful. Stimulus measures can be an opportunity to invest in economic transformation and technological innovations that are necessary to deliver sustainable development. Both the short term and long-term stimulus measures should aim at achieving the multiple purposes of delivering economic prosperity, widening wellbeing, enhancing resilience, strengthening circular economy, and decarbonising growth.</p><p>Building on what has been announced, the bloc should strengthen the functional effectiveness of the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency by enhancing budgetary support.</p><p>Nevertheless, Vietnam should also ensure that all of the ASEAN dialogue partners are committed to the above goals and their development aid budgets remain ring-fenced but enlarged, and not diverted to domestic priorities.</p><p>This is where true humanity and solidarity in international co-operation must be demonstrated. If an enhanced regional co-operation and strong leadership were ever necessary in the ASEAN, it is now more than ever before.</p><p><em>This opinion piece was&nbsp; written by ERIA&#039;s&nbsp; Senior Energy Economist, Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi, and has been published in&nbsp; <a title="Read this op-ed in The Jakarta Post" href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/paper/2020/06/22/from-covid-19-containment-to-economic-cure-an-asean-action-agenda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Jakarta Post,</a> <a title="Read this piece in Vietnam Investment Review" href="https://www.vir.com.vn/from-containment-to-recovery-rescuing-the-asean-from-crisis-76544.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vietnam Investment Review</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<a title="Read this piece in Vietnam Net" href="https://vietnamnet.vn/en/business/from-containment-to-recovery-rescuing-the-asean-from-crisis-644933.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vietnam Net</a>, and <a title="Read this op-ed in The Manila Times" href="https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/06/18/opinion/analysis/from-covid-19-containment-to-economic-cure-an-action-agenda-for-asean/732465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Manila Times</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p>";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2020-05-28";s:12:"article_type";s:4:"news";}i:7;a:5:{s:3:"uri";s:53:"industry-40-empowering-asean-for-the-circular-economy";s:5:"title";s:55:"Industry 4.0: Empowering ASEAN for the Circular Economy";s:7:"content";s:6503:"<p>The transition to a circular economy is a unique opportunity for fast-growing Asian economies to be resource efficient, competitive, and innovative.

By creating an enabling policy framework for circular economy, government can also motivate corporate leaders to achieve greater benefits for sustainable development.
