<p><strong>Jakarta, 21 February 2023: </strong>Applying existing and affordable fuels and energy technologies to expand the use of natural gas is one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That was the gist of the message delivered by Prof Hidetoshi Nishimura, President of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), at a workshop on Prospects of a Natural Gas Market in the East Summit (EAS) Region Amidst Carbon Neutrality Pledges and Geopolitical Tensions. Held at Fairmont Hotel in Jakarta, the workshop was sponsored by ERIA and the Gas Exporting Country Forum (GECF).</p>
<p>Prof Nishimura said that decarbonising energy systems requires the rapid scaling up of existing cleaner energy sources and technologies with essential support for policy, fiscal, and monetary incentives, and appropriate market design.</p>
<p>Delivering the workshop&rsquo;s opening remarks was H.E. Eng Mohamed Hamel, GECF&rsquo;s Secretary General, who forecast that in the ASEAN region, natural gas demand was expected to more than double, rising to more than 350 billion cubic metres by 2050.</p>
<p>H.E. Mr Arifin Tasrif, Indonesia&rsquo;s Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, citing the country&rsquo;s natural gas potential, said that the challenges are developing the infrastructure connecting the pipeline from western to eastern Indonesia, and creating a new policy framework to attract investment into the natural gas market. He mentioned that the use of natural gas has diversified into the fertiliser, petrochemical, and glass industries, amongst others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Aydar Shakirov, GECF&rsquo;s Head of Gas Market Analysis Department, citing GECF&rsquo;s analysis, explained that since the ASEAN region is both an exporter and importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), it is expected to contribute to higher LNG trade in the short term, driven by the start &nbsp;of Indonesia&rsquo;s Tangguh LNG train and the launch of LNG regasification terminals in the Philippines and Viet Nam. A substantial investment, Dr Shakirov added, is needed to fully capitalise this potential.</p>
<p>Dr Hussein Moghaddam, GECF&rsquo;s Acting Head of Energy Economics and Forecasting Department, forecast that by 2050, the cumulative upstream and midstream investment required to satisfy global gas demand would reach US$10.5 trillion.</p>
<p>In the case of East Asia Summit (EAS) Region, Mr Shigeru Kimura, ERIA&rsquo;s Special Advisor to the President on Energy, said that natural gas is a key fuel in the energy transition period to achieve carbon neutrality and, with carbon capture and storage (CCS), will remain so until 2050. He noted that efforts to switch from coal to gas amongst power plants have been observed in some ASEAN countries. Meanwhile, negating fossil fuel investment could prolong the current energy crisis, erode economic growth, and hamper public support to climate actions, warned Prof Jun Arima, ERIA&rsquo;s Senior Policy Fellow for Energy and Environment.</p>
<p>During the panel discussion moderated by Dr Alloysius Joko Purwanto, ERIA&rsquo;s Energy Economist, Prof Tutuka Ariadji, Director General of Oil and Gas of Indonesia&rsquo;s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, explained the country&rsquo;s&nbsp; oil and gas strategies that contribute to energy transition by implementing Zero Routine Flaring in 2030 in oil and gas business activities, and applying CCS and carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) programmes. He reported that the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has finalised a draft ministerial regulation on CCS/CCUS for oil and gas work areas.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the natural gas and LNG market outlook for 2023, Mr Yui Torikata, Senior Energy Analytic Product Specialist of the data and analytics firm Kpler, said the trend shows global LNG supply rising to an estimated 420 million tonnes in 2023, whilst increasing demand in China due to economic reopening and new long-term LNG contracts is expected to be offset by losses in Japan and the Republic of Korea caused by increasingly available nuclear power. Mr Yusuke Hidaka, Senior Analyst of the Gas Group, The Institute of Energy Economics, Japan, said that to secure LNG in the medium to long term, investment is crucial in LNG production projects as trade in LNG and natural gas is expected to increase to 430 million tonnes in 2023.</p>
<p>Joining online, Dr Eng. Nawal Yousif Al-hanaee, Director of Future Energy Department of the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, United Arab Emirates(UAE), shared the progress of UAE&rsquo;s energy transition, including the National Energy Strategy 2050, the net-zero strategic initiative 2050, clean energy projects, and hydrogen and CCUS initiatives. She said the UAE is actively growing its international energy partnership to accelerate the development of the global hydrogen economy.</p>
<p>Closing the workshop, Mr Tetsuya Watanabe, Special Advisor to the President of ERIA, listed strategies to help the region meet its energy demand and strengthen its export positions in the global gas market whilst gaining the necessary funding: exploit not only conventional natural gas sources but also unconventional resources, have timely and well-planned investment strategies in the natural gas supply chain, and introduce environmentally sound technologies and techniques in projects.</p>

<p><strong>Jakarta, 9 February 2023:</strong> The inclusion of persons with disabilities is a key priority for ASEAN. Over decades, despite significant commitments, barriers to inclusion of persons with disabilities persist. Whilst the rapid growth of digital technology might be an enabler in promoting inclusiveness in the region, it might also be a disruptor due to the existence of the digital divide. Whilst much discussion addresses the digital divide and promotes digital inclusion in the ASEAN region, focus has typically been on demographics such as women or people living in rural areas. Beyond fleeting mentions of accessibility, persons with disabilities remain overlooked.</p>
<p>The issue was addressed at a dissemination event, on 9 February 2023, for the recent study on <a href="https://test-www-eria-org.azurewebsites.net/research/technology-and-disability-trends-and-opportunities-in-the-digital-economy-in-asean/">Technology and Disability: Trends and Opportunities in the Digital Economy in ASEAN</a>. Conducted by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) in partnership with Impact46, the dissemination event discussed the role of technology in education and overall technology in improving the lives of people with disabilities. Impact46 is an asset manager and advisor that specialises in alternative investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Opening the event, Kate Goodfruit,&nbsp;First Secretary of the Australian Mission to ASEAN, remarked on Australia&rsquo;s steadfast and ongoing commitment to promote gender equality &nbsp;and social inclusion through its foreign policy strategy, economic diplomacy, and development work. She stressed the importance of collective actions from multiple stakeholders across the ASEAN region to actualise the potential of technology in improving the lives of persons with disabilities and to facilitate their inclusion.</p>
<p>Ashling Cashmore,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Head of Impact and Advisory at Charities Aid Foundation and the author of the ERIA Report on Technology and Disability, presented the study, where she discussed the role of technology-enabled working environments and digital jobs for persons with disabilities. She said that with the rising digital technology in ASEAN, possessing digital skills is required, yet the persistent barriers for people with disabilities may exacerbate the digital divide. She then reported the collective efforts from various stakeholders to promote more inclusion for persons with disabilities in ASEAN.</p>
<p>Darren Chua,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Inspirational Speaker and Empowerment Coach at Mindset Transformation Clinic, shared his insights on how remote working since the COVID-19 pandemic has benefitted persons with disabilities to acquire more flexibility in the working environment. However, he also mentioned the importance of providing accessibility and reducing physical barriers for persons with disabilities, especially in the post-pandemic period. As an initial step in promoting a more inclusive working environment, he said it is important to shift mindsets and eliminate prejudice towards persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>Rubeena Singh,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Senior Manager for Research and Thought Leadership at Kite Insights, said that inclusive education aims to provide equitable access for all students, allowing them to adopt mainstream education based on their individual learning needs. With the robust digital transformation, it is important, she said, to equip educators with relevant digital skills and knowledge of assistive technology and better understanding to assess the needs of disability learners. As lack of teachers with such capacity becomes one of the barriers in promoting inclusive education, she offered five key recommendations to level up the capacity of teachers, including 1) providing the teachers with professional and ongoing training development, 2) equipping the teacher with accessible resources and latest technology skills, 3) promoting inclusive education design for policymakers, 4) enhancing collaboration amongst educators, and 5) promoting student-centred approach.</p>
<p>Neelesh Bhatia,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Founder and CEO of Akadasia, Singapore, spoke of a gap that remains despite the collective efforts to promote inclusion in the learning ecosystem. He said this includes affordable assistive technology, lack of dedicated support staff, and lack of awareness and understanding amongst the teachers, discriminatory and stereotype. He added that it is necessary to understand the root problems in teacher&rsquo;s capacity, which include low salary and lack of motivation for upscaling. He indicated the need to inject more investment to narrow the gap between public and private schools, promote more affordable assistive technology, and provide an equitable learning management system for students.</p>
<p>Thanchanok Jiraphakorn,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Head of Learning and Development at Vulcan Coalition, Bangkok, called for teachers to be equipped with training and education related to digital technology. &nbsp;She pointed out the importance of training teachers on assistive technology and providing more accessible and affordable technology in the learning management system. She shared how Vulcan created a business model that allows persons with disabilities to learn and be equipped with artificial intelligence skills and data analytics and thrive in the current digital environment.</p>

The transformation of the global value chain (GVC) in the digital, trade, and services sectors has created new economic opportunities for ASEAN&rsquo;s emerging economies, including those of the Lao People&rsquo;s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The change has been further intensified by the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade agreement.</p><p>To view these changes, the Capacity Building Program (CBP) of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) and Lao PDR&rsquo;s Ministry of Planning and Investment held the second evidence-based workshop on 6&ndash;9 February 2023 to examine the effects of trade liberalisation on the domestic economy. More than 30 participants from Lao PDR&rsquo;s various ministries, including of planning and investment, public works and transport, and industry and commerce, attended the workshop. The ERIA CBP is supported by the Government of Australia.</p><p>The key objective of the workshop was to develop the capacity of Lao PDR&rsquo;s government officials to explore the implications on the domestic economy of implementing the country&rsquo;s RCEP commitments and focus on policy strategies to maintain Lao PDR&rsquo;s competitiveness resulting from structural transformation in the region.</p><p>The workshop was opened by Dr Sithiroth Rasphone, Director General of the Development Research Institute of Lao PDR&rsquo;s Ministry of Planning and Investment, who noted the importance of developing a policy framework to identify the structural gaps in key fundamentals in the domestic economy, such as skills, domestic industry, infrastructure, technology, and institutions. He mentioned Lao PDR&rsquo;s potential to develop modern services with respect to liberalisation in the RCEP framework.</p><p>During the 4-day workshop, the participants learnt about key issues associated with transforming the services and industrial sectors, human capital development, institutional reforms, GVC, city linkages, and urban agglomeration.

The transformation of the global value chain (GVC) in the digital, trade, and services sectors has created new economic opportunities for ASEAN&rsquo;s emerging economies, including those of the Lao People&rsquo;s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The change has been further intensified by the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade agreement.
To view these changes, the Capacity Building Program (CBP) of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) and Lao PDR&rsquo;s Ministry of Planning and Investment held the second evidence-based workshop on 6&ndash;9 February 2023 to examine the effects of trade liberalisation on the domestic economy. More than 30 participants from Lao PDR&rsquo;s various ministries, including of planning and investment, public works and transport, and industry and commerce, attended the workshop. The ERIA CBP is supported by the Government of Australia.
The key objective of the workshop was to develop the capacity of Lao PDR&rsquo;s government officials to explore the implications on the domestic economy of implementing the country&rsquo;s RCEP commitments and focus on policy strategies to maintain Lao PDR&rsquo;s competitiveness resulting from structural transformation in the region.
The workshop was opened by Dr Sithiroth Rasphone, Director General of the Development Research Institute of Lao PDR&rsquo;s Ministry of Planning and Investment, who noted the importance of developing a policy framework to identify the structural gaps in key fundamentals in the domestic economy, such as skills, domestic industry, infrastructure, technology, and institutions. He mentioned Lao PDR&rsquo;s potential to develop modern services with respect to liberalisation in the RCEP framework.
During the 4-day workshop, the participants learnt about key issues associated with transforming the services and industrial sectors, human capital development, institutional reforms, GVC, city linkages, and urban agglomeration. At the end of the workshop, the participants were divided into groups, each tasked to research and develop a paper on topics including mapping GVC, small and medium-sized enterprises, and social policy development in Lao PDR.
