This observation was made by Mr Koji Hachiyama, Chief Operating Officer of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) during the Regional Consultative Workshop on Student Learning Loss in Reading and Mathematics at Primary Schools during COVID-19 Pandemic in ASEAN, held on 26&ndash;27 October 2022 in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The workshop was attended by some ASEAN Senior Officials&nbsp;Meeting on Education (SOM-ED), international organisations, non-governmental organisations, and selected teachers from several provinces of Cambodia. H.E. Dr Nath Bunroeun, Secretary of State, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of Cambodia, and Mr Hachiyama presided over the 2-day workshop.</p><p>Mr Hachiyama cited as an example of learning loss during the pandemic the case of Cambodia, where students&rsquo; reading score achievement declined from 51.9% in 2016 to 48.6% in 2021. He noted that other ASEAN countries have been similarly impacted by the pandemic. These findings, he said, are now contributing to a redirection of policy to bridge those losses, which otherwise could impact child development and the quality of ASEAN&rsquo;s human resource. &nbsp;He counted the Research Study on Learning Loss in Reading and Mathematics at Primary School Level During the Pandemic in ASEAN Region as amongst the most important projects ERIA has supported.</p><p>Mr Hachiyama reported that ERIA was pleased with the signing in February 2022 of a memorandum of understanding between the institute and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) Pillar, as represented by its Lead, H.E. Dr Hang Chuon Naron. He said this had opened the way for ERIA to go beyond ASEAN&rsquo;s Economic Community towards a broader aspect of ASCC.</p><p>Mr Hachiyama spoke of the importance of ERIA&rsquo;s Comprehensive Asian Development Plan (CADP 3.0), a key document to guide policy covering a wide range of sustainable development, to ensure inclusive growth for ASEAN and East Asia. He said the plan&rsquo;s major relevance to the workshop is the importance of digital connectivity, which is key to realising inclusive growth. He explained that digital connectivity expands the scope of the supply of goods and medical, educational, and government services in rural areas; and allows people living anywhere to access even the global labour market, connect people to people, and address issues of communication as well as online social learning and businesses.</p><p>Closing the workshop, Mr Han Phoumin, ERIA&rsquo;S Senior Energy Economist, said the rich discussions amongst practitioners and experts during the workshop immensely shaped the understanding of the complexity and impact of learning losses during the pandemic. He remarked that although remedial and policy measures are taking place, these should be hastened to address issues affecting vulnerable students, particularly those in rural areas.</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:117:"/uploads/news/20221026/2022_oct_student-learning-loss-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-discussed-in-siem-reap_800x450.jpg";s:11:"posted_date";s:15:"26 October 2022";s:3:"uri";s:82:"student-learning-loss-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-discussed-in-siem-reap-workshop";s:3:"cat";s:6:", News";s:4:"tags";s:216:"<br><a href='http://localhost/myApp/WEBSITE-ERIA-ORG/www.eria.org/update/brows/all/Cambodia' >Cambodia</a>,&nbsp<a href='http://localhost/myApp/WEBSITE-ERIA-ORG/www.eria.org/update/brows/all/Education' >Education</a>";}i:1;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:80:"Inclusive Education in ASEAN: Fostering Belonging for Students with Disabilities";s:7:"content";s:4332:"<p><strong>Jakarta, 21 July 2022:</strong> Inclusive education systems and ecosystem should be a key focus of education policies in ASEAN Member States and East Asian countries, where students, including those with different physical and intellectual abilities, can avail themselves of opportunities to acquire the tools to flourish. Because the region&rsquo;s countries are developing, their economic growth might be unable to support increased funding for education. Many are still struggling to provide equitable opportunities to students returning from school closures in the post-pandemic recovery period. The region must ensure that students with disabilities, who already face several barriers to accessing quality education, are not left behind.</p><p>The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) released, in a webinar held on 21 July 2022, <a href="/publications/inclusive-education-in-asean-fostering-belonging-for-students-with-disabilities/">Inclusive Education in ASEAN: Fostering Belonging for Students with Disabilities</a>, a study on inclusive education practices in primary and secondary schools in the ASEAN region and selected countries in East Asia. &nbsp;The event was supported by the Australian government.</p><p>Antonella Noya, Head of Social Economy and Innovation Unit of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), highlighted the importance of &nbsp;socio-economic&nbsp; approaches that put people at the centre of operation whilst being driven by the value of solidarity and democracy to attain social values that enable the inclusion of persons with disabilities. She explained OECD&rsquo;s recent adoption of social innovation policy recommendations that will support policymakers in designing public policy that contribute to more inclusive, creative, and sustainable societies and economies.</p><p>Adrian Gilbert, First Secretary of the Australian Mission to ASEAN, focused on several regional commitments, such as the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, that aim to promote greater inclusion across all aspects of ASEAN activities. &nbsp;He noted the importance of the ERIA study that covers current practices of inclusive education and provides cross-cutting recommendations that can be implemented by ASEAN and East Asia to ensure that students with disabilities have the right to quality and equitable education.</p><p>Rubeena Singh, author of the ERIA Report on Inclusive Education and Manager of Research and Knowledge of Kite Insights, presented the key findings of the research project. She said that inclusive education is necessary from preschool to post-secondary levels and in technical and vocational training. She concluded that inclusive education enables transformative learning opportunities for all students to build an inclusive, more resilient society.</p><p>In the panel discussion, Dr Tze Peng Wong, Associate Professor of the School of Education, University of Nottingham Malaysia, cited the need to address inclusive education&rsquo;s lack of resources, awareness, and policies. Dr Darren Chua, inspirational speaker and empowerment coach of the Mindset Transformation Clinic Singapore, brought up the importance of using certain terms&nbsp; such as &lsquo;people with different abilities&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;persons with disabilities&rsquo;.&nbsp; Dr Roger Chao Jr., Assistant Director and Head of the Education, Youth and Sports Division of the ASEAN Secretariat, spoke on the importance of integrated policies and policy advocacy to &nbsp;better understand inclusive education. He called for better provision of financial and human resources and capacity in the implementation of policies at the grassroots level.</p><p>The webinar&rsquo;s panel discussion was moderated by TJ Ooi, Lead Consultant of ERIA&rsquo;s Entrepreneurship, Start-ups, and Innovation Knowledge Lab, whilst the question-and-answer session was moderated by Lina Maulidina Sabrina, ERIA&rsquo;s Programme Officer, who discussed the key actions that need to be done amongst stakeholders to promote inclusive education in ASEAN.</p><p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZ__JwlQrvs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:96:"/uploads/news/20220721/2022-07-21-inclusive-education-in-asean-webinar-photo-session-800x450.jpg";s:11:"posted_date";s:12:"21 July 2022";s:3:"uri";s:79:"inclusive-education-in-asean-fostering-belonging-for-students-with-disabilities";s:3:"cat";s:6:", News";s:4:"tags";s:268:"<br><a href='http://localhost/myApp/WEBSITE-ERIA-ORG/www.eria.org/update/brows/all/Education' >Education</a>,&nbsp<a href='http://localhost/myApp/WEBSITE-ERIA-ORG/www.eria.org/update/brows/all/Strategy and Partnership Programme' >Strategy and Partnership Programme</a>";}i:2;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:96:"It is Time for Inclusive Education in ASEAN - Fostering Belonging for Students with Disabilities";s:7:"content";s:6462:"<p><em><strong>By Rubeena Singh:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em>This is the decade of change. The COVID-19 pandemic, recent geopolitical conflicts, climate change, have pushed us to think about the greatest challenges of our time and re-assess the ways in which we do things. The education system needs a hard look, too.</p><p>While the term &lsquo;inclusion&rsquo; has surfaced as a megatrend across public and private sectors in the last couple of years, it is no stranger to the world of education. What is new however, is the realization by governments and civil society that inclusive education involves more than simply placing a student with a disability in the classroom. Many education systems claim to be inclusive but are instead following either segregated or integrated models, missing the mark on meaningful inclusion.</p><p>Inclusive education requires systems change, one that stems from a change in mindsets and skillsets to foster a sense of belonging for all students in the classroom. Systems change requires principles of inclusion such as whole-system inclusion, the role of learning-friendly environment, how to adapt a curriculum to student needs, differential learning, and universal design for learning (UDL), amongst others. The UNICEF report Education for Every Ability (2020), offers entry points for practical improvements in each of these domains.</p><p>Students with disabilities who are included in school are healthier, can apply their skills to other settings, look forward to going to school, and are more likely to be civically engaged and employed later in life. Students without disabilities have much to gain too, including broadening their perspective taking skills, opportunities to collaborate in creative ways, and understand first hand, the process of inclusive community building. These are just some of the reasons we need to make a change now.</p><p>International reports suggest that are about 43.1 million children (0-18 years of age) with physical and/or intellectual disabilities in East Asia and the Pacific (UNICEF, 2021). Many of these children do not attend school at all and are vulnerable to entering the informal job market, child marriage, and experiencing exploitation, violence, and poverty.</p><p>While school closures from the COVID-19 pandemic have caused devastating effects on student learning, their closures have offered us an opportunity to think about meaningful inclusion in schools. School closures have affected a staggering 140 million students in Southeast Asia and 260 million students in East Asia (UNICEF, 2021). UNESCO estimates that at least 2.7 million children will not return to school, in addition to the 35 million students in East Asia and the Pacific who have dropped out (Hulshof and Tapiola, no date). Students with disabilities are more likely to remain out of school once schools fully reopen, which can perpetuate a cycle into poverty.</p><p>It is true that all 10 ASEAN member states (AMS) aspire to create inclusive education systems for students with disabilities shown by their commitments to international, regional, and national frameworks these ambitions, but they can struggle to make progress on the ground.</p><p>Challenges in making progress are abundant, but those same challenges lend themselves to innovative opportunities. For example, even before entering a classroom, a medical model diagnosis is limited in its ability to present a student&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses in the learning process and may lead to a segregated intervention and education planning. This challenge has sprouted the need for a functional approach to data collection. The Washington Group/UNICEF Child Functioning Module identifies children who have difficulties that can hinder learning by understanding varying degrees of limitations in their functions as interactions with the environment. A disability is, after all, a barrier between a person and their environment, and this Module shifts our thinking to see this connection more clearly.</p><p>Another fundamental challenge lies in the heart of the education system &ndash; teacher training. High quality and consistent pre-service and in-service teacher education remain fundamental for inclusive education. Funding, political will, and incentives for teachers can support this cause.</p><p>Finally, a country&rsquo;s leadership has the power to set the tone for a cultural shift towards inclusion. Leaders must be inclusive themselves, publicly use inclusive language, and advocate for the human rights of all their constituents, including those with disabilities.</p><p>In summary, inclusive education is necessary at all levels of education, from preschool to post-secondary school, in technical and vocational training. It is an agent of change to encourage lifelong learning and full participation in social, economic, and political life. Inclusive education is not just for students with disabilities but can offer transformative learning opportunities for all students to build an inclusive, more resilient society.</p><p>References:</p><ul><li>ASEAN (2015), <em>ASEAN 2025 Forging Ahead Together.</em> Jakarta.</li><li>ASEAN (2020), <em>ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework.</em> Jakarta.</li><li>ASEAN (2020), <em>Implementation Plan: ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, 2020.</em> Jakarta.</li><li>CAST (2018),&nbsp;<a href="http://udlguidelines.cast.org/">Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 2.2</a>.
