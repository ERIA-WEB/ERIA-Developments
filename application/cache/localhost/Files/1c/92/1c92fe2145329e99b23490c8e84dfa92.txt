Indonesia&rsquo;s upcoming presidency is poised to bring major contributions to global development which is still recovering from the health and economic crisis brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing health and economic crises, as well as the rising nationalism and export restraints, make global coordination on many pressing issues especially important in this difficult time. There are not many international fora that are capable of fostering a coordinated global response to crisis at a scale of G20.&nbsp; Indonesia proposes the theme of &lsquo;<em>Recover Together, Recover Stronger</em>&rsquo; and has committed to lead discussions that will result in concrete actions to achieve inclusive, people-centred, environment-friendly, and sustainable growth on the global scale. As a developing economy, the G20 Presidency is Indonesia&rsquo;s great opportunity to represent developing economies&rsquo; concerns and voices on the post-COVID-19 recovery strategy, rebalancing economic power, and the importance of inclusive growth.&nbsp;</p><p>ERIA will support Indonesia&rsquo;s G20 presidency through research and policy recommendations.&nbsp; We will host several events and publish news and research throughout the year.&nbsp; Please contact us <a title="click here to send us an email" href="mailto:contactus@eria.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a> if you want more information.

Given the high share of fossil fuels in the current energy mix of ASEAN and EAS (oil, coal, and natural gas make up almost 80% of the primary energy mix for both the ASEAN and EAS region), the clean use of fossil fuels through the deployment of clean technologies is indispensable for decarbonising emissions in ASEAN and the EAS region. The future energy transition of ASEAN and the EAS region will rely on today&rsquo;s actions, policies, and investments to change the fossil fuel-based energy system towards a cleaner energy system. But any decisions and energy policy measures to be rolled out during the energy transition need to be weighed against potentially higher energy costs, affordability issues, and energy security risks. The continued use of fossil fuel to steer economic growth in ASEAN and the EAS region will require appropriate technologies to use fossil fuels in responsible and environmentally friendly ways through clean technologies such as clean coal technology and carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS), to decarbonise the region&rsquo;s emission in the foreseeable future.</p>";s:13:"external_link";s:1:"0";s:10:"image_name";s:49:"/uploads/categories/istock-1182779865_665x270.jpg";s:9:"published";s:1:"1";s:8:"order_id";s:2:"90";s:13:"meta_keywords";s:40:"carbon capture, utilisation, and storage";s:16:"meta_description";s:40:"carbon capture, utilisation, and storage";s:13:"modified_date";s:19:"2021-05-29 11:31:06";s:11:"modified_by";s:1:"4";s:7:"old_url";N;}i:9;O:8:"stdClass":15:{s:11:"category_id";s:3:"297";s:13:"category_type";s:10:"categories";s:9:"parent_id";s:1:"0";s:3:"uri";s:59:"organisation-for-economic-co-operation-and-development-oecd";s:13:"category_name";s:61:"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)";s:11:"description";s:1671:"<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sf_compact_textregular, arial, sans-serif;">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an organisation with a mission to promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
