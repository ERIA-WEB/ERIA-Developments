It is expected to contribute intellectually to the regional efforts for ASEAN Community building and East Asia economic integration. Its role is to provide policy analyses and recommendations to Leaders and Ministers at regional meetings such as the ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting, EAS Energy Ministers Meeting (EMM), ASEAN Summit, and the EAS.</p><p>We all know that the role of CCUS is very crucial in clean energy transitions as it is the only technology that contributes both to directly reducing emissions in the identified highly energy intensity economic sectors and to removing CO2 to balance emissions that cannot be avoided.&nbsp; One way to reduce emissions is carbon recycling. After the CO2 is captured, the CO2 is used to create&nbsp;new materials and products. Instead of just sequestering the CO2, the CO2 will be utilised to make everything from fuel, concrete, and shoes, to cleaning products, plastics, and food. This allows us actually to recycle the emissions and create a circular carbon economy.</p><p>However, the deployment of CCUS will need to have appropriate supporting policies and investments. Thus, in supporting the development of CCUS policy, technical experts will need to understand the technical aspect of the CCUS and its technologies. To help the policymakers in developing appropriate policies in supporting the CCUS development and deployment, this study will bring the best collective practices in terms of policies and CCUS technologies that can be adopted for ASEAN and East Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Potential Issues for Study</h2><p>ERIA would like to invite proposals of study to promote the understanding of various policy instruments necessary for the development and deployment of CCUS. In this regard, we are looking for proposals that address issues related to policies, techno-economic analysis of CCUS, and value chain. The study will form into a workable document that covers:</p><ul><li><strong>Overview of CCUS Development and Deployment around the world</strong></li><li><strong>Needed policies to promote CCUS</strong> (Legislative, Carbon Price/Market and trading, and other policy incentives).</li><li><strong>CCUS Value Chain</strong> (Developing industrial clusters for carbon capture, transport, and regional carbon stock potentials)</li><li><strong>CCUS technologies</strong> (carbon captures, carbon transport, and carbon recycling).</li></ul><p>These themes are illustrative and proposals on other related topics of CCUS will be given equal consideration.</p><p>The proposal will include at least the following parts:</p><ul><li>Research question (s);</li><li>Background and value-added to the literature.</li><li>Data and methodology (analytical framework)/ or any innovative ways to illustrate the intended study</li><li>Expected policy implications. Asia CCUS Network&rsquo;s studies are policy orientated and it is essential that the study delivers policy implications for ASEAN and East Asia.</li></ul><p>Together with the proposal, the lead researcher will submit a brief CV with a list of publications (if the researcher has not been a member of ERIA&rsquo;s Working Group in the past) and a sample paper, preferable in a journal article style if any.</p><h2>Timeframe and administrative issues</h2><p>To be fully considered, proposals should be submitted to Mr Han Phoumin (han.phoumin@eria.org) and to Ms Dian Lutfiana (dian.lutfiana@eria.org).no later than <strong>30 September</strong>&nbsp;<strong>2022.</strong> &nbsp;Early submission is encouraged.

It is expected to contribute intellectually to the regional efforts for ASEAN Community building and East Asia economic integration. Its role is to provide policy analyses and recommendations to Leaders and Ministers at regional meetings such as the ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting, EAS Energy Ministers Meeting (EMM), ASEAN Summit, and the EAS.</p><p>The economic recovery plans for 2021&ndash;2022 increased the global energy demand, resulting in a sharp increase in the prices of oil and other fossil fuels. However, the increase in fossil fuel prices could not stimulate new investments in renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects. The main reason behind this low level of investment and the reluctance of private investors toward the green sector is the existence of various risks and economic uncertainty, which has forced the investors to look for safer assets. This low level of interest toward renewable energy and green infrastructure investments threatens the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the achievement of several sustainable development goals (SDGs).</p><p>The current investment levels in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in the ASEAN region and East Asia are insufficient to achieve the carbon neutrality goals by 2050. Renewable energy projects have more difficulties compared to other projects in accessing finance. The main challenges that renewable energy projects face for accessing finance are lack of long-term financing, the existence of various risks, Lower rate of return in renewable energy projects, and lack of capacity in market actors. Hence, for achieving energy transition and carbon neutrality goals, we need to scale up the financing of investments that provide environmental benefits through innovative ways. In the wake of COVID-19, the importance of innovative ways and policies for enhancing investments in renewable energy projects to achieve climate-related goals is highlighted.</p><h2>Potential issues for the study</h2><p>With this background, ERIA would like to invite proposals of study on innovative ways for financing renewable energy projects in ASEAN and East Asia.</p><p>The call for proposals seeks empirical and policy-oriented studies on ASEAN member states and East Asian economies that deal with innovative and market-based solutions for unlocking private investments in renewable energy projects. The final manuscripts will consist of papers developed based on a sound theoretical framework and significantly contribute to the literature. The project aims to collectively provide policy recommendations for designing funding strategies for renewable energy development in ASEAN and East Asia. The project aims to provide lessons to end-users, policymakers, and market players in ASEAN and East Asia on access to finance for renewable energy development.</p><p>Proposals may deal with, but not limited, to the following:</p><ul><li>Innovative and market-based instruments and renewable energy deployment.</li><li>Role of green finance in renewable energy development.</li><li>Analyzing renewable energy financing programs in ASEAN and East Asia.</li><li>Obstacles for renewable energy financing and solutions.</li><li>Green bonds, renewable energy, and energy transition</li><li>Carbon taxation for renewable energy development.</li><li>Role of governments in unlocking the private investments in renewable energy projects.</li><li>Roles of institutional innovation, innovation in products, and processes in renewable energy development.</li><li>Public supports for investments in renewable energy projects during the pandemic and in the post-pandemic.</li><li>Role of new technologies in easing access to finance for renewable energy development.</li><li>Case studies on utilizing innovative finance and FinTech in funding renewable energy projects.</li><li>Application of AI, DLT or blockchain, peer-to-peer lending platforms, big data, internet-based and mobile-based payments, IoT, matchmaking platforms including crowdlending and tokenizing green assets in scaling up renewable energy financing.</li><li>Role of venture capital, crowdfunding, angel investment, and partner financing in funding renewable energy projects.</li></ul><h2>Terms of Reference</h2><p class="pdf"><a href="/uploads/media/call-for-proposals/2022_March_CfP_Innovative-Ways-for-Financing-Renewable-Energy-Projects-in-ASEAN-and-East-Asia.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Innovative Ways for Financing Renewable Energy Projects in ASEAN and East Asia</a></p><p><a href="/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&nbsp;Please note that this proposal is sub-theme under the project of &ldquo;Economic Analysis of Large-Scale Deployment of Solar PV with Battery Storage in ASEAN and East Asia</p>";s:10:"image_name";s:44:"/uploads/news/20220309/istock-1128888172.jpg";s:11:"posted_date";s:12:"9 March 2022";s:3:"uri";s:97:"call-for-proposals-innovative-ways-for-financing-renewable-energy-projects-in-asean-and-east-asia";s:3:"cat";s:6:", News";s:4:"tags";s:126:"<br><a href='http://localhost/myApp/WEBSITE-ERIA-ORG/www.eria.org/update/brows/all/Call for Proposals' >Call for Proposals</a>";}}s:1:"g";a:0:{}s:1:"e";O:8:"DateTime":3:{s:4:"date";s:26:"2022-12-21 07:06:57.798146";s:13:"timezone_type";i:3;s:8:"timezone";s:13:"Europe/Berlin";}s:1:"m";N;s:1:"c";N;}
