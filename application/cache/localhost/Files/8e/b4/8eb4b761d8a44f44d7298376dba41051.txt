RKC-MPD has established an online platform titled &lsquo;Private sector initiatives to reduce plastic waste and marine plastic debris&rsquo; (https://rkcmpd-eria.org/story). This online interface called the Private Sector Platform (PSP) in short, hosts information submitted by private companies operating in all ASEAN+3 countries to showcase their products, services, or technologies contributing to the reduction of plastic waste and marine plastic debris. The platform collects and disseminates private companies&rsquo; business activities that are conducive to marine plastics mitigation. It also aims to encourage Business-to-Business, Business-to-Government and/or Business-to-Consumer opportunities in the ASEAN+3 region.</p><p>The forum will be an occasion for the Ministry of Environment of Cambodia, Cambodian business alliances, and Cambodian private companies to stocktake the progress made, and discuss the many ways private companies can contribute in combatting plastic waste and marine plastic debris. RKC-MPD will reintroduce the Private Sector Platform (PSP) to the public, particularly to the private companies, to raise more awareness of the platform and attract a larger number of private companies to join the fight against marine plastics.</p><h2>Event Details</h2><ul><li>Date: Friday, 5 August 2022</li><li>Time: 8:30 AM -&nbsp; 12:00 PM (Jakarta/Phnom Penh time, GMT+7)</li></ul><h2>Agenda</h2><table><tr><td width="104"><p>08:30 &ndash; 08:50</p></td><td width="497"><p><strong>Welcome Remark:</strong></p><ul><li>Dr Aladdin D.

The forums will provide a platform to bring together representatives of diverse stakeholders to share knowledge on the latest research and insights on relevant topics on post-pandemic recovery in order to inform the policy discourse. It is hoped that the insights and recommendations from the forums can contribute to different sectoral work in ASEAN towards recovery. The vision of these Forums is to &lsquo;Build Back Better&rsquo; so that the region&rsquo;s recovery policies result in a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable region.</p><p>&nbsp;With over a hundred million hectares of agricultural land, ASEAN is a major producer, supplier, and exporter of various crops and grains, particularly rice. ASEAN is the world&rsquo;s largest producer of palm oil and natural rubber and raises a considerable amount of livestock. The COVID-19 pandemic, which is disrupting every economy-supporting sector in the ASEAN&nbsp;region, is expected to pose challenges to trade, investment, and economic growth. The agriculture and food sector is one of the most vulnerable sectors affected by the pandemic as it is heavily linked with key economic factors such as global agricultural commodities trade in the region (trade and regional integration), and more importantly, food supply and food security (trade and sustainable development).</p><p>&nbsp;While the supply of food has held up well to date, in many countries, the measures put in place to contain the spread of the virus are starting to disrupt the supply of agro-food products to markets and consumers, both within and across borders. How damaging these impacts will be for food security, nutrition, and the livelihoods of farmers and others working along the food supply chain will depend in large part on policy responses over the short, medium and long term.</p><p>&nbsp;On 14 April 2020, the Statement of the ASEAN Ministers on Agriculture and Forestry (AMAF) in Response to the Outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) to Ensure Food Security, Food Safety and Nutrition in ASEAN was issued to contribute to overcoming the challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak and to ensure the sustainable supply of sufficient, affordable, safe and nutritious foods that meet the dietary requirements of the ASEAN populations. One of the commitments from the AMAF is to further exchange views and collaboration in food, agriculture and forestry development with other sectors and partners to address the adverse impacts of COVID-19. The AMAF will strive to keep ASEAN food, agriculture and forestry strong during the COVID-19 outbreak by continuously maintaining production, supporting value chains and ensuring access to the workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;The first Forum focused on the opportunity to reset towards more sustainable growth, highlighting the challenges faced by the agriculture and food sector as well as discussing policy options for the agriculture and food sector in ASEAN to overcome the adverse impact of COVID-19.</p><p><iframe style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/gyCCoekCGKMe0T" width="668" height="714" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"> </iframe></p><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a title="ASEAN on Point: Ensuring the Resilience and Sustainability of the Agriculture and Food Sector in ASEAN in the Context of COVID-19" href="//www.slideshare.net/ERIAOrg/asean-on-point-ensuring-the-resilience-and-sustainability-of-the-agriculture-and-food-sector-in-asean-in-the-context-of-covid19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN on Point: Ensuring the Resilience and Sustainability of the Agriculture and Food Sector in ASEAN in the Context of COVID-19</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ERIAOrg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia</a></strong></div><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;">&nbsp;</div><h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Download Report</h2><p class="pdf"><a title="ASEAN on Point Public Forum: Ensuring the Resilience and Sustainability of the Agriculture and Food Sector in ASEAN in the Context of COVID-19" href="/uploads/media/ASEAN-on-Point-Report-1-Food-Agriculture-COVID-19.pdf">ASEAN on Point Public Forum: Ensuring the Resilience and Sustainability of the Agriculture and Food Sector in ASEAN in the Context of COVID-19</a></p><h2>Event Recording</h2><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dbEJOtjGQw4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2020-09-03";s:12:"article_type";s:12:"publications";}i:2;a:5:{s:3:"uri";s:70:"realizing-asean-smart-cities-a-webinar-with-dr-venkatachalam-anbumozhi";s:5:"title";s:79:"Realizing ASEAN Smart Cities â€“ A Webinar with Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi";s:7:"content";s:3278:"<p><strong>Jakarta, 14 May 2020:</strong> A webinar dialogue on Realizing Smart Cities was jointly hosted by the Smart Cities Network and Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).&nbsp; The dialogue was moderated by Kok-Chin (KC) Tay, Chairman of the Smart Cities Network based in Singapore. Dr. Venkatachalam Anbumozhi, Senior Economist and the Principle Investigator of the ERIA study on Realizing Smart Cities, explained the drivers of Smart Cities, and provided an update on the research findings to date and ways to launch smart cities in ASEAN and beyond. 138 participants representing policy making, business, academia and the public participated in this virtual dialogue, and shared their perspectives on smart cities.</p><p>In his opening remarks, Mr Tay highlighted the historical development of the ASEAN Smart City Network (ASCN), highlighting the enabling environment in Singapore as a Smart Nation.</p><p>Dr Anbumozhi, the main speaker, explained there are no clear guidelines for developing smart cities; each city has its own definition. Transforming cities into smart cities is key to providing &lsquo;intelligent solutions&rsquo; to the challenges of urbanization, said Dr Anbumozhi. Generally speaking, a &lsquo;smart city&rsquo; can be understood as a city that has improved facilities and services in order to deal with urbanization challenges including energy, mobility, ICT, waste and wastewater management, and emissions reduction.</p><p>The ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) includes six components common to smart city development: (a) smart governance, (b) smart living, (c) smart economy, (d) smart people, (e) smart environment, and (f) smart mobility.&nbsp; ICT, data management and the Internet of Things (IoT) also play essential roles to enable a smart city environment. Learning from Singapore, the cities of Chiang Mai, Johor Bahru and Jakarta, have employed a common but differentiated technology roadmap to achieve smart city goals.</p><p>In terms of financing smart cities, Dr Anbumozhi suggested that collaboration amongst stakeholders is crucial. City governments have budget allocations for city improvement that can be used for smart city development. Meanwhile, community funding, such as crowdfunding may be tapped to fund development. However city governments need to coordinate policies and decisions with other levels of national governments.&nbsp; In addition to that, Mr Tay suggested that Public-Private Partnership (PPP) should be considered as well.</p><p>The preliminary conclusion of this research study covers three points: there is an opportunity in ASEAN for a paradigm shift towards sustainable cities, technology development is critical for infrastructure and service delivery, and incorporation of digital intelligence, digital inclusion and innovation networks into strategic planning of ASEAN Smart cities models is important.</p><p class="pdf"><a title="Realizing Smart Cities - Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi" href="/uploads/media/0.-Realizing-Smart-Cities---Anbu-PPT.pdf">Realizing Smart Cities - Dr Venkatachalam Anbumozhi</a></p><p class="pdf"><a title="Realizing Smart Cities - Mr KC Tay" href="/uploads/media/0.-Realizing-Smart-Cities---KC-Tay-PPT.pdf">Realizing Smart Cities - Mr KC Tay</a></p>";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2020-05-18";s:12:"article_type";s:10:"multimedia";}i:3;a:5:{s:3:"uri";s:11:"lurong-chen";s:5:"title";s:11:"Lurong Chen";s:7:"content";s:249:"<div class="profile-text-detail1"><p><br></p><ul><li>Economic Digitalisation and Servicification</li><li>Asian Regionalism and FTAs</li><li>GVCs and Production Sharing</li><li>Trade and Investment Related IPRs</li><li>Chinese economy</li></ul></div>";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2020-05-12";s:12:"article_type";s:7:"experts";}i:4;a:5:{s:3:"uri";s:66:"eria-participates-in-the-asean-business-and-investment-summit-2019";s:5:"title";s:66:"ERIA Participates in the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit 2019";s:7:"content";s:4209:"<p><strong>Bangkok, 2 November 2019</strong>: Industry 4.0 and technological development needs to be human-centric; therefore, workers of all ages&mdash;not just the young&mdash;need to be equipped with relevant skills for the digital transformation of our economies and societies, said ERIA President Prof Hidetoshi Nishimura in the first panel discussion session &lsquo;Advancing ASEAN 4.0 in the Global Value Chain&rsquo; of the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit (ABIS) 2019. Prof Nishimura and a delegation of ERIA experts participated in the two-day event organised by the Government of Thailand and ASEAN Business Advisory Council (ABAC) on the sidelines of the 35th ASEAN Summit.</p><p>&nbsp;Prof Nishimura suggested that, with advanced communications technology, traditional sectors can be upgraded through a &lsquo;micro-macro information loop&rsquo;, where small businesses can access relevant market information in their hand-held mobile device. He shared his optimism that servicification of manufacturing, where manufacturing activities increasingly rely on services, will create new economic opportunities in the region by allowing ASEAN businesses to remotely perform specialised tasks for firms located in developed country. Prof Nishimura also presented a new video based on <a href="/publications/asean-vision-2040-volume-iii-transforming-and-deepening-the-asean-community/">ASEAN Vision 2040 Volume III : Transforming and Deepening the ASEAN Community</a>. The ASEAN Vision 2040 is ERIA&rsquo;s flagship publication of 2019, which was developed upon the request of the Government of Thailand as part of their deliverables for the Chairmanship of ASEAN.</p><p>Prof Nishimura shared the stage with Ms Gabriela Ramos, OECD Chief of Staff and Sherpa to the G20; Mr Justin Wood, Head of Asia Pacific Agendas of the WEF; and Mr Nobuhiko Sasaki, Chairman of JETRO, Japan.</p><p>During her presentation, Ms Ramos underlined the need of a complex set of skills in future generation of students and workers (such as critical thinking, collaboration and team-working, self-confidence). She also spoke about the need for SMEs and newly created firms to access data, a resource increasingly fundamental to be able to compete in the digital economy. Policymakers around the world must think about how to make sure the SME and newly created firms can access and use data and to avoid barriers to enter specific markets.</p><p>Mr Wood highlighted the increasing size of services in advanced economies and GVC worldwide. He also suggested that it is time to move from the definition of economies of scale to the one of economies of skills as investors and FDIs are increasingly moving towards those location where skills can be found.</p><p>As the last speaker of the panel, Mr Sasaki praised the establishment of an ASEAN Economic Community and stated that the time has come to think about the next steps. He mentioned the need to reduce NTMs to facilitate trade across countries. Digital rules and strategies for Industry 4.0 are also important policy development that need to be addressed in the future in ASEAN.</p><p>During the second day of ABIS 2019, Dr Rashesh Shrestha, Economist of ERIA, spoke during the panel &lsquo;ASEAN Human Empowerment and Development (AHEAD)&rsquo;. He emphasised the need for better skills in macro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in ASEAN. A broad skill set is needed: technical STEM skills need to be combined with soft skills and also a combination of cognitive and non-cognitive skills is required. In addition to urgently investing in good quality education, governments in ASEAN need to embark on broad labor market reforms to increase formalization, flexibility, and skill mobility in order to create the incentives for investment in skill development by students and workers. &nbsp;</p><p>Around 1,000 high-level government officials from ASEAN countries, private sectors, ASEAN&rsquo;s dialogue partners, civil society organizations, and academic and research institutions attended ABIS 2019. Keynote addresses were given by world leaders including Prime Ministers of Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Russia, as well as HRM Duke of York.</p>";s:11:"posted_date";s:10:"2019-11-02";s:12:"article_type";s:10:"multimedia";}i:5;a:5:{s:3:"uri";s:42:"smes-productivity-better-but-still-limited";s:5:"title";s:52:"SMEsâ€™ productivity: Better, but still limited";s:7:"content";s:921:"<p><em>Note: This article was&nbsp;<a title="SMEs&rsquo; productivity: Better, but still limited" href="https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/466952/smes-productivity-better-but-still-limited.html#d9Au0C1Y0HQ0Gix6.97" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">originally published in Viet Nam News</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;2 October 2018.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;ERIA&#039;s Senior Economist, <a href="/experts/dionisius-a-narjoko/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Dionisius Narjoko</a> was featured.</p><p>Viet Nam News H&Agrave; Ná»˜I &mdash; Although Viá»‡t Nam has focused on increasing labour productivity and overall productivity growth, there have been relatively few opportunities for SMEs to get customised support as they grow, said Max Bulakovskiy, policy analyst in Global Relations at the Organisation for Economic Coâ€‘operation and Development (OECD).
