During the third quarter of 2022, venture capital (VC) investments and deals globally fell to levels not seen since the beginning of the&nbsp;<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-vc-funding-pullback-q3-2022-monthly-recap/">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. This slowdown in investment is hitting North America and Europe particularly hard &mdash; but Asia is being affected too.</p><p>During 2022, the slowdown in investments hit both high-income and emerging Asia, with Asia&rsquo;s largest economies, India and China, being heavily affected. Layoffs of tech workers are becoming increasingly common.</p><p>The negative outlook is the result of a complex combination of factors: the largely hawkish policies of central banks, developed economies attempting to curb post-COVID-19 inflation (primarily the rate hikes by the Federal Reserve resulting in a very strong US dollar), Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent volatility in food and energy prices. While 2021 was an ideal year to be an early-stage tech entrepreneur and investor, the same cannot be said for 2022.</p><p>Trends across ASEAN exhibit, to some extent, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/southeast-asia-venture-capital-vc-firms-will-be-pickier-in-2023-.html?utm_source=CARI+Master+List&amp;utm_campaign=235e138605-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_02_17_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_92a8302563-235e138605-68002839">similar evolution</a>. A fast acceleration of deals and investments in the lead up to 2022, followed by a recent slowdown, inevitably accompanied by layoffs by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/14/1136659617/tech-layoffs-amazon-meta-twitter">many tech giants.</a>&nbsp;According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://asean.org/book/asean-investment-report-2022/">ASEAN Investment Report 2022</a>, VC investments continued to grow from the mid-2010s, to reach more than US$66 billion in mid-2022. VC investment in the region rose by a factor of 2.6 between 2015 and 2020, outperforming both China and India.</p><p>This phenomenon shows the great innovation potential of ASEAN. The significant growth of VC investments has helped the region to give origin to more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/home">40 &lsquo;unicorns</a>&rsquo; &mdash; start-ups valued at over US$1 billion. The now famous post-initial public offering (IPO) digital giants, the large majority of which operate in the digital economy sector, can also be credited to this growth. VC investments in ASEAN remain primarily concentrated in Singapore, ASEAN&rsquo;s leading innovation hub, and Indonesia, ASEAN&rsquo;s biggest market. But the proportion of investments&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/07/01/addressing-the-digital-divide-in-asean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">going to other countries</a>&nbsp;like Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia or the Philippines&nbsp;<a href="https://asean.org/book/asean-investment-report-2022/">has recently been growing</a>.</p><p>In 2022, these investments have begun to slow down. The amounts raised by ASEAN start-ups were down by around&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/data-stories-h1-2022-private-equity-and-venture-capital-trends-in-asean">40 per cent</a>&nbsp;during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the previous year. The digital economy so far appears to have remained resilient. Start-ups and deals related to tech and internet sectors were affected by smaller declines, if any. But investors are now more cautious,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/sea/e-conomy-sea-2022/">especially vis-a-vis late-stage investments</a>, as IPO gains are becoming less likely in the current macroeconomic scenario.</p><p>Global conditions are currently far from ideal for investors and early-stage entrepreneurs and the global economic outlook remains extremely volatile and very difficult to predict for the medium to long term. But there is no reason to be overly pessimistic when looking at ASEAN.</p><p>The region is characterised by a strong macroeconomic performance. ASEAN&rsquo;s economic growth is projected to be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adb.org/outlook">above 5 per cent in 2022 and 2023</a>, outperforming China for the first time. This very favourable macroeconomic outlook will certainly be appreciated by international and regional investors.</p><p>ASEAN is still perceived by international investors as a high-growth potential and less known Asian market when compared not only to developed Asian economies, like Japan or South Korea, but also to large emerging ones, like China and India. There is also room to expand the role of regional investors. ASEAN-based private equity and VC firms are a growing source of funding for start-ups and for cross-border activities, but in 2021 they accounted for&nbsp;<a href="https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AIR2022-Web-Online-Final-211022.pdf">less than a quarter of investment</a>&nbsp;into ASEAN-focused venture capital funds.</p><p>A vast majority of leading ASEAN venture capital firms and funds are headquartered in Singapore, but there is an opportunity for an expansion of activities in other ASEAN countries. Policies to support the emergence and consolidation of innovation ecosystems both in individual ASEAN member states and on a regional level could significantly accelerate this process.</p><p>Such policies include boosting investments in research and development in both public and private organisations and strengthening connections with leading innovation hubs in Asia to increase the quality of research and higher education institutions. Examples of initiatives going in this direction exist in both more and less advanced ASEAN countries: from Malaysia&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://irep.iium.edu.my/91895/">Entrepreneurship Action Plan Higher Education Institutions 2021&ndash;2025</a>&nbsp;to the recently established&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cadt.edu.kh/">Cambodia Academy of Digital T</a>echnology in Phnom Penh.</p><p>The digital economy also continues to grow fast in the region. According to the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/sea/e-conomy-sea-2022/">e-Economy report by Google, Temasek and Bain &amp; Company</a>, the digital economy across &lsquo;ASEAN-6&rsquo; (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) is expected to reach US$200 billion in gross merchandise value in 2022. This is three years earlier than originally estimated by the 2016 edition of the same report. The region saw the emergence of 100 million new internet users over the last three years. E-commerce and fintech are growing steadily.</p><p>These reasons for cautious optimism for growth and the evolution of the ASEAN start-up ecosystem should not delay much-needed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/07/09/investing-in-the-skills-to-accelerate-equitable-digital-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">policy developments</a>. Innovation-driven entrepreneurs have much to benefit from more integrated ASEAN economies. More coherent and cohesive regulation, especially in the digital space, and enhanced improvements in physical and digital infrastructure and cross-country connectivity are just a few advantages. Most important of all, increased integration allows significant investments in skills development as well as talent attraction, retention and circulation on a regional and global scale.</p><p>ASEAN is very well positioned to become a leading innovation hub over the next decades. It is important to address these issues now for the transformation to happen sooner.</p><p><em>This opinion piece was written by ERIA&#039;s Strategy and Partnership Director, Ms Giulia Ajmone Marsan, and has been published in <a href="https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/12/30/southeast-asias-tech-industry-goes-from-a-gallop-to-a-canter/">East Asia Forum</a>.&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:58:"/uploads/news/20221230/charlesdeluvio-pjah2ax4uwk-tech.jpg";s:11:"posted_date";s:16:"30 December 2022";s:3:"uri";s:60:"southeast-asias-tech-industry-goes-from-a-gallop-to-a-canter";s:3:"cat";s:10:", Opinions";s:4:"tags";s:320:"<br><a href='http://localhost/myApp/WEBSITE-ERIA-ORG/www.eria.org/update/brows/all/ASEAN' >ASEAN</a>,&nbsp<a href='http://localhost/myApp/WEBSITE-ERIA-ORG/www.eria.org/update/brows/all/Start-up' >Start-up</a>,&nbsp<a href='http://localhost/myApp/WEBSITE-ERIA-ORG/www.eria.org/update/brows/all/Technology' >Technology</a>";}i:1;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:38:"Asean's international status is rising";s:7:"content";s:8009:"<p><em><strong>By Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, Senior Communications Advisor:&nbsp;</strong></em>It might sound pompous to keep stating the strategic importance of Southeast Asia over the past year due mainly to the three heavy-weight summits held in the neighbourhood. Historically speaking, it has always been this way since the colonial period when European powers gobbled up land, suppressed local people, and gained and influenced footholds throughout the region&#039;s mainland and archipelagos.</p><p>Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24, the war has helped to highlight the value of Southeast Asia under the umbrella of Asean and put the bloc on the global geostrategic map. In the past, it was the Cold War that placed Southeast Asia at the heart of regional conflict.</p><p>It was a clearly ideological, divided world. Southeast Asia opted for the free world. This time around, it is a different ballgame. The region can make a choice, refusing the outside powers&#039; impositions or hegemonic inclinations.</p><p>Throughout the Ukraine war, Western countries have paid little attention to developing or smaller nations that could not contribute to the military effort to beat Russia. In the case of Asean, they wanted the bloc to follow diplomatic moves by imposing sanctions to punish Russia. Only one country complied. Other members did not.</p><p>For Asean, economic sanctions would not help end the war but would only escalate it and cause further suffering to civilians.</p><p>As such, it was natural that the ongoing conflict would permeate regional agendas, including the Asean-related summit, G20 and Asia Pacific Leaders Meeting in Phnom Penh, Bali and Bangkok. Before these summits, nobody would predict that the three hosts would be able to rise to the occasion.</p><p>After all, the countries in Southeast Asia held different views and positions that puzzled the Western world. In more ways than one, these divergences were derived from the Western domination and post-colonial experience of their nation-building process, which still continues today.</p><p>Throughout these years, Southeast Asian nations have learned the art of surviving and coexisting with both friendly and hostile great powers in their neighbourhood.</p><p>Inevitably, with the three summits held in Southeast Asia, all major powers have had to take notice of the outcomes of these leaders&#039; meetings, especially their demeanours at various events. Some new diplomatic trends occurred during November of 2022 -- some of which could have long-term implications for the emergence of a new international order.</p><p>First of all, the most visible feature has been the diplomatic capacity and finesse of developing countries in looping in great powers. They want to make sure that their home grounds are not used for confrontation. For instance, as the host of the Asean-related summit, Prime Minister Hun Sen utilised the event to show off post-war Cambodia and its diplomatic balancing acts with all concerned parties.</p><p>Ukraine&#039;s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was invited to Phnom Penh to meet up with Asean foreign ministers and signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC). The TAC is a regional conduct agreement with clear stipulations of respect for national sovereignty and integrity, non-use of force, and non-interference of internal affairs, among others.</p><p>Ukraine&#039;s accession sent a strong signal to Moscow of its commitment to the regional code of conduct. Russia, which signed the TAC in 2005, should have complied voluntarily with it. Life today for Russia, its people and the rest of the world would be in a better condition. Today, there are 50 signatories of the TAC from the world&#039;s four continents.</p><p>As a bloc, Asean has earned its centrality as never before. Previously, Asean centrality meant the bloc set its own agenda and stuck to its region. But now Asean has taken the initiative.</p><p>Each Asean member, which hosted a summit, has contributed to the strengthening of the bloc&#039;s centrality, contrary to what some critics may say -- that it&#039;s irrelevant, ununified and unable to settle its own crises.</p><p>Such a bleak assumption is understandable because, in the age of social media, the optics of progress and success is pivotal. Politicians and policymakers want to score points as early as possible, especially during a time of crisis, no matter how fragile the situation might be.</p><p>In the case of Myanmar, during the 1988 Burmese crisis, Asean did not have the same pressure that it and the concerned parties are facing today. Now they are all using social media to propagate their activities, imagined or real, further complicating efforts to fund durable solutions.</p><p>In addition, leaders of great powers still need leaders from developing and small countries to serve as a bridge or sometimes as a cushion. After all, they are non-threatening partners. As the G20 demonstrated, Indonesia has served as a bridge for all protagonists to get together and agree on a common communique. Both the leaders of the US and China also felt comfortable meeting in Bali.</p><p>Furthermore, due to the US-China rivalry, both superpowers are reaching out nonstop to garner more support from countries -- many from regions that would be overlooked under normal circumstances. Southeast Asia, the South Pacific Islands and Africa are now topping their agenda.</p><p>In the coming years, in particular the Year of the Tiger, Southeast Asia will become even more important because of the operationalisation of various Indo-Pacific strategies.</p><p>At the moment, there are at least ten assortments of Indo-Pacific strategies with shared commonalities. Within the region, Japan, India and Korea would put into good uses their Indo-Pacific frameworks.</p><p>These frameworks identified Southeast Asia as their core which links the Indian and Pacific Oceans together. As such, from now on, the region can no longer stay passive and idle. Under the Indonesian chair, Asean will be more confident in managing ties with the great powers.</p><p>At the Phnom Penh summit, the Asean leaders adopted the guidelines to mainstream the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP).</p><p>It is not an overstatement to say that for any Indo-Pacific strategy to succeed, it needs to realign with the AOIP. Asean has the intention to use the AOIP as a guideline-cum-tool to navigate and manage these competing strategies so that they don&#039;t end up entangling or overlapping with one another.</p><p>Most importantly, the AOIP will ensure that no program or activity undertaken by Asean is turning one party against the other.</p><p>Southeast Asia is rising. Overall, in the coming years, the region will attract more capital, investors and visitors despite its diversities and levels of development.</p><p>According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the economic growth of Asean will be hovering around 5.2% in 2023.</p><p>In comparison with the rest of the world, the region&#039;s prospect looks pretty good.</p><p>After all, Southeast Asia still remains the fulcrum for all great powers, big or small, to convene and be convinced of their power projections and influence. The region can make its own decision.</p><p><em>This opinion piece was written by ERIA&#039;s Senior Communications Advisor, Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, and has been published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2469610/aseans-international-status-is-rising" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The&nbsp;Bangkok Post</a>.&nbsp;<a title="Subscribe to ERIA FRAMES" href="http://eepurl.com/bSCVl1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the monthly newsletter.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia.</em></p>";s:10:"image_name";s:38:"/uploads/news/20221227/4581220_790.jpg";s:11:"posted_date";s:16:"27 December 2022";s:3:"uri";s:37:"aseans-international-status-is-rising";s:3:"cat";s:10:", Opinions";s:4:"tags";s:100:"<br><a href='http://localhost/myApp/WEBSITE-ERIA-ORG/www.eria.org/update/brows/all/ASEAN' >ASEAN</a>";}i:2;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:77:"ASEAN Envoys, Dialogue Partners Urge ERIA to Undertake New Fields of Research";s:7:"content";s:1662:"<p><strong>Jakarta, 2 December 2022:</strong> Aiming to promote research and other cooperation in the post&ndash;COVID-19 pandemic era, several diplomats of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have suggested that the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) undertake various key areas of research.

However, global uncertainties are undermining prospects for a return to strong and lasting growth. Among the top concerns is the geopolitical uncertainty including the Russian invasion to Ukraine, global economic risks (such has trade and supply chain disruption, high commodity prices and financial stress) and the rising inequality especially on the increased number of people in extreme poverty and job loss over the past 2 years. More so, with limited fiscal space and rising debt, countries and policy makers are faced with difficult challenges to make sure that the post-pandemic recovery scenarios are taking into account the sustainability or SDG aspects and staying on a net-zero path.</p><p>Co-organized by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), the webinar discussed some of the implication of competing short-term, medium-term and long-term challenges on the region&rsquo;s prospect and solutions to build a resilient and sustainable recovery. The webinar was joined by more than 480 participants across the region.</p><p><strong>Ramesh Subramaniam</strong>, Director General, Southeast Asia Department, ADB, set the scene by highlighting the optimistic view for the region&rsquo;s prospect of growth although challenges remain.

He explained the need for fiscal policies where government must maintain a smart expenditure in healthcare, education and social protection.

She also highlighted the importance of accelerating transition to digital economy and how the growing innovation in the region plays an important role for an inclusive post pandemic recovery.</p><p><strong>Aladdin D. Rillo, </strong>Senior Economic Advisor, Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) emphasized the need for ASEAN to work together and maximize its role in regional and multilateral cooperation such as RCEP or other regional trade agreement.
