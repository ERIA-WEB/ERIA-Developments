<p><strong>Jakarta, 3 November 2022:</strong> The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) through a collaboration between the Entrepreneurship, Startups, and Innovation&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esi-eria.org/">(E-S-I) Knowledge Lab</a>&nbsp;and the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris&nbsp;<a href="https://rkcmpd-eria.org/">(RKC-MPD)</a>&nbsp;hosted a webinar on 3 November 2022, titled 'Female Entrepreneurs in the ASEAN Region: Innovation to Tackle Marine Plastic Waste'. This webinar aimed to raise awareness about the alarming marine plastic pollution and highlight the innovative efforts taken by the private sector in addressing the issue.</p>
<p>The webinar invited three female entrepreneurs addressing plastic waste issues in the region&mdash;Ms Ovy Sabrina&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://rebricks.id/">Rebricks Indonesia</a>,&nbsp;Dr Supatchaya Techachoochert&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.refillstationbkk.com/">Refill Station</a>&nbsp;in Thailand, and&nbsp;Ms Juliana Adam&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biji-biji.com/">Biji-biji Initiative</a>&nbsp;in Malaysia&mdash;who shared their respective stories, including challenges and lessons learned that came along their journey as sustainability entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The three women admitted that their forays into sustainable business were somewhat accidental, but the goal was similar: Promoting zero waste lifestyle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Me and my partner, Novita, were beginning to practice the lifestyle when we realised there are certain types of plastic waste that we cannot recycle,&rsquo; said Ms Sabrina, referring to her business partner, Rebrick CEO, Novita Tan.</p>
<p>Not wanting to 'pass down' non-recyclable plastic waste to their children&rsquo;s generation, both came up with an idea to recycle plastic waste into building materials and founded Rebricks Indonesia.</p>
<p>As for Ms Adam, it was the endeavour to generate alternative incomes for underserved community members in Malaysia that led her way to become an entrepreneur. Together with her team, she is working to improve the livelihood of others while also championing environmental sustainability through her waste recycling and management company, Biji-biji Initiative.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr Techachoochert&rsquo;s interest in the business grew when living alternately between the forest and the city for her doctoral research in Biology.&nbsp; As she observed how most environmental problems are rooted in urban lifestyle, she decided to open Refill Station to raise public awareness of plastic waste. Today, that first bulk store in Thailand she co-founded with her friends is more than just a business.</p>
<p>'Having a store is a kind of communication channel, so I have more room to express my interest, talk about the problem, and I can point out what other alternatives that people can do to help,' Ms Techachoochert explained.</p>
<p><strong>Changing Consumer Behaviour: Between Incentives and Facilities</strong></p>
<p>In the efforts to encourage recycling behaviour, the ability to compromise is important for entrepreneurs to have. Dr Techachoochert learned that taking a hard-liner approach will lose people&rsquo;s adherence. She believes that by being a leader who is adaptive and able to compromise, one can set an example that could encourage people to follow.</p>
<p>Ms Adam observed how in Malaysia, giving incentives to make people segregate and recycle their waste seems to work to build the habit of recycling among underserved community members. However, the same approach did not work as well for urban areas, she said.</p>
<p>The situation is similar with Indonesia. According to Ms Sabrina, incentives only worked for the area where such income had a meaningful impact. &lsquo;Urban communities, especially middle-class citizens, do not care about the incentives; they would take action only when a formal system is in place,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Dr Techachoochert said that infrastructure should be in place to support people in segregating and recycling waste. She shared a story about a family member who used to segregate waste when living in Japan but stopped the practice once she moved back to Thailand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because there are no facilities to build trust. It is contradictory when we tell people to segregate waste at home, but the government only provides one bin to dump every waste into. There is no clear visibility that the mixed waste will be segregated and recycled at the end,&rsquo; she explained.</p>
<p><strong>Private Sector and Government Need to Move at the Same Pace</strong></p>
<p>The private sector in Thailand, according to Ms Techachoochert, is generally quite aware of and enthusiastic about addressing plastic pollution. However, despite the recent good news about the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) implementation, she thought the government is still relatively slow in responding to this issue.</p>
<p>'The private sector is getting ready, but laws and policies are holding them back from moving forward,' she said.</p>
<p>Ms Adam, however, believes private sector could elevate the environmental debate by simply adopting green practices without having to wait for policies to precede. &lsquo;Sure, policies should be put in place, but I strongly believe that each individual and organisation, each business, must take the initiatives on their own,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>She added that business owners can start small by evaluating their operational practices, switching plastic packaging to more sustainable alternatives, and forming partnerships with other stakeholders to ensure material circularity.</p>
<p>In terms of sustaining their business, Ms Sabrina believes social entrepreneurs need to balance their idealism and their adaptability. &lsquo;At the end of the day, as an entrepreneur, you need to sell. Otherwise, you cannot sustain your company. You need to create revenue, otherwise, you cannot create more impact,&rsquo; she said, adding that having the right business partner enables her to balance these two important sides.</p>
<p><strong>Various Government Supports to Accelerate Impactful Businesses</strong></p>
<p>When asked about other supports needed from the government, Dr Techachoochert said the government should be able to respond to the rapid changes quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They used to give classification codes for products that come with containers but did not provide any codes for refilling products that come without containers. Despite this, we didn&rsquo;t give in, we kept pushing on. And then the government approached us to gain some insights from our business, and only later did they launch relevant policies after the shop had been already operational,' she said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ms Techachoochert hopes that the government could help promote the businesses and educate the public about the problem they are trying to solve through various communication channels under the authority.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, Ms Adam said a policy aiming to enable multistakeholder partnerships has been in place. This policy fosters collaborations between big corporations, non-governmental organisations, and social enterprises to create a collective impact.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For example, recognising the impact that the third sector can create, and then ensuring support from the bigger players. Although the policy is in place, the execution is another story. But I feel like it is a good first step towards it,&rsquo; she explained.</p>
<p>Ms Adam highlighted another big challenge: the lack of local recycling infrastructure. She said she hoped logistic support to set up the necessary infrastructure, especially from the government, could come into place.</p>
<p>Ms Sabrina, meanwhile, urged the government to allow SMEs like her own to be the supplier for government projects.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our team has worked hard to create reliable products at a competitive price, and despite having ample supply of non-recyclable plastic waste to create eco-friendly construction material, the demand for our products is not up to par. We believe the opportunity to be a government supplier will significantly leverage our business and the impact we could create.&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Mr Michikazu Kojima, Senior Advisor to the President on Environmental Issues at ERIA who also leads the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris, reiterated the important roles played by the private sector to lead the way for a more circular economy for plastics.</p>
<p>'I believe we can all agree that the private sector plays an instrumental role in our collective efforts to put a break on the current trend of plastic pollution. With its economic leverage, the private sector has the potential to nudge the conventional and linear way of plastic consumption and production towards a more circular one,' said Mr Kojima.</p>
<p>Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, the Director of Strategy and Partnerships of ERIA, said entrepreneurs and business models can really offer very important solutions for this pressing global challenge. &lsquo;Therefore, it is very important also for policymakers to hear from entrepreneurs and innovators,' Dr Marsan said.</p>

The private sector in Thailand, according to Ms Techachoochert, is generally quite aware of and enthusiastic about addressing plastic pollution. However, despite the recent good news about the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) implementation, she thought the government is still relatively slow in responding to this issue.
'The private sector is getting ready, but laws and policies are holding them back from moving forward,' she said.
Ms Adam, however, believes private sector could elevate the environmental debate by simply adopting green practices without having to wait for policies to precede. &lsquo;Sure, policies should be put in place, but I strongly believe that each individual and organisation, each business, must take the initiatives on their own,&rsquo; she said.
She added that business owners can start small by evaluating their operational practices, switching plastic packaging to more sustainable alternatives, and forming partnerships with other stakeholders to ensure material circularity.
In terms of sustaining their business, Ms Sabrina believes social entrepreneurs need to balance their idealism and their adaptability. &lsquo;At the end of the day, as an entrepreneur, you need to sell. Otherwise, you cannot sustain your company. You need to create revenue, otherwise, you cannot create more impact,&rsquo; she said, adding that having the right business partner enables her to balance these two important sides.
Various Government Supports to Accelerate Impactful Businesses
When asked about other supports needed from the government, Dr Techachoochert said the government should be able to respond to the rapid changes quickly.
&lsquo;They used to give classification codes for products that come with containers but did not provide any codes for refilling products that come without containers. Despite this, we didn&rsquo;t give in, we kept pushing on. And then the government approached us to gain some insights from our business, and only later did they launch relevant policies after the shop had been already operational,' she said.
Additionally, Ms Techachoochert hopes that the government could help promote the businesses and educate the public about the problem they are trying to solve through various communication channels under the authority.
In Malaysia, Ms Adam said a policy aiming to enable multistakeholder partnerships has been in place. This policy fosters collaborations between big corporations, non-governmental organisations, and social enterprises to create a collective impact.
&lsquo;For example, recognising the impact that the third sector can create, and then ensuring support from the bigger players. Although the policy is in place, the execution is another story. But I feel like it is a good first step towards it,&rsquo; she explained.
Ms Adam highlighted another big challenge: the lack of local recycling infrastructure. She said she hoped logistic support to set up the necessary infrastructure, especially from the government, could come into place.
Ms Sabrina, meanwhile, urged the government to allow SMEs like her own to be the supplier for government projects.
&lsquo;Our team has worked hard to create reliable products at a competitive price, and despite having ample supply of non-recyclable plastic waste to create eco-friendly construction material, the demand for our products is not up to par. We believe the opportunity to be a government supplier will significantly leverage our business and the impact we could create.&rsquo; she said.
Mr Michikazu Kojima, Senior Advisor to the President on Environmental Issues at ERIA who also leads the Regional Knowledge Centre for Marine Plastic Debris, reiterated the important roles played by the private sector to lead the way for a more circular economy for plastics.
'I believe we can all agree that the private sector plays an instrumental role in our collective efforts to put a break on the current trend of plastic pollution. With its economic leverage, the private sector has the potential to nudge the conventional and linear way of plastic consumption and production towards a more circular one,' said Mr Kojima.
Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, the Director of Strategy and Partnerships of ERIA, said entrepreneurs and business models can really offer very important solutions for this pressing global challenge. &lsquo;Therefore, it is very important also for policymakers to hear from entrepreneurs and innovators,' Dr Marsan said.             2022-11-03 3 November 2022 2202 rebmevoN 3 30-11-2202             .dias nasraM rD ',srotavonni dna sruenerpertne morf raeh ot srekamycilop rof osla tnatropmi yrev si ti ,eroferehT;ouqsl& .egnellahc labolg gnisserp siht rof snoitulos tnatropmi yrev reffo yllaer nac sledom ssenisub dna sruenerpertne dias ,AIRE fo spihsrentraP dna ygetartS fo rotceriD eht ,nasraM enomjA ailuiG rD

<p><strong>Phnom Penh, 12 September 2022</strong>: The emerging energy topics of decarbonisation and carbon mitigation efforts have been challenges for the ASEAN region, and global concerns regarding climate change put more pressure on the region to contribute to the low carbon transition. The necessity of carbon neutrality to accelerate Paris Agreement goals was highlighted at the Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow 2021 where participating countries announced the goal of carbon neutral targets by 2050 depending on international support. However, the Russia-Ukraine war has brought an imbalance of demand-supply of fossil fuel globally, affecting the significant increase of global energy costs which interferes with global commodity prices and trade. The energy supply shortage also impedes global energy security.</p>
<p>To address these issues, the Fifth East Asia Energy Forum (EAEF) was held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia with the theme &lsquo;ASEAN&rsquo;s Challenges on Carbon-Neutrality and Energy Security&rsquo;. The results of the day&rsquo;s discussions are captured in the <a href="https://test-www-eria-org.azurewebsites.net/uploads/media/2022_September_Phnom-Penh-Reflections.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lsquo;Phnom Penh Reflections&rsquo;</a>.</p>
<p>The forum was privileged to have a welcoming remark by H.E. Suy Sem, Minister of Mines and Energy, Cambodia. His Excellency highlighted the global energy issues which have been exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war. &lsquo;The world needs to develop a smooth energy transition while minimising the use of fossil fuels, therefore we must commit to continuing fight against climate change by strengthening cooperation and collaboration to find solutions for both climate and energy development of the country according to the resources, responsibilities and capability of each country,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>His Excellency pointed out that Cambodia takes this opportunity to contribute to achieving carbon neutrality by preparing the Power Development Plan for 2022-2040. &lsquo;[&hellip;]the key to carbon neutrality is to mobilise huge investment and the facilitation of investment climate for clean energy and renewable energy projects, as well as financing infrastructure projects to assimilate existing coal-fired and gas-fired power generation to using clean technologies, carbon capture, utilisation and storage and hydrogen technologies, as well as upgrades or add-ons equipment or technology for all aspects of power generation, from upstream to downstream and into the entire energy system,&rsquo; said H.E. Suy Sem.</p>
<p>For his opening remarks, H.E. Dato Lim Jock Hoi, Secretary-General of ASEAN, pointed out the continuous efforts to find solutions for decarbonisation and climate mitigation efforts within the region through this forum. &lsquo;ASEAN has been pressing to contribute to low carbon and sustainable future. Within the ASEAN economic pillar, consolidation intervention has been put in place to accelerate sustainability initiative, including on-going effort on Circular Economy Framework and on-going preparation on carbon neutral strategy for ASEAN,&rsquo; he said. His Excellency also stated that the support of the finance and banking sector for the carbon neutrality strategy will expedite the realisation of energy security, affordability, and accessibility. The outcomes of this forum will be reported to the next EAS Energy Ministers Meeting.</p>
<p>Several high-level officials from energy ministries from ASEAN countries, Japan and the United States participated in this forum to convey their commitments to be part of international cooperation for achieving carbon neutrality targets within the region. Global energy experts, policymakers, academia, public, and private institutions such as ASEAN Centre for Energy (ACE), Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ), International Energy Agency (IEA), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Kpler, and MUFG Bank also took part in the forum&rsquo;s panel discussion and deliberate over the Russia-Ukraine War impacts on global energy security, actions towards affordable energy transition as well as securing investment towards carbon-neutrality efforts.</p>
<p>As a closing remark, the President of ERIA, Prof Hidetoshi Nishimura emphasised several points on the importance of securing natural gas supply, including its investment within the region. Furthermore, multiple pathways toward carbon neutrality should be in place for achieving ASEAN decarbonisation and carbon neutrality targets by 2060. &lsquo;Stakeholders including the governments, financial institutions, and the private sector in the ASEAN region will need to make the actions clear on the technology transition while simultaneously promoting renewables and clean technologies. In addition, ASEAN countries should raise their voices in the international debate on green finance so that diverse national/regional circumstances could appropriately be taken into consideration,&rsquo; said Prof Nishimura. &nbsp;</p>

The necessity of carbon neutrality to accelerate Paris Agreement goals was highlighted at the Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow 2021 where participating countries announced the goal of carbon neutral targets by 2050 depending on international support. However, the Russia-Ukraine war has brought an imbalance of demand-supply of fossil fuel globally, affecting the significant increase of global energy costs which interferes with global commodity prices and trade. The energy supply shortage also impedes global energy security.
To address these issues, the Fifth East Asia Energy Forum (EAEF) was held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia with the theme &lsquo;ASEAN&rsquo;s Challenges on Carbon-Neutrality and Energy Security&rsquo;. The results of the day&rsquo;s discussions are captured in the &lsquo;Phnom Penh Reflections&rsquo;.

<p><strong>Bali, 2-4 September 2022: </strong>More than 200 global innovation players including start-ups, venture capitalists, corporates, and policymakers gathered in Bali, Indonesia, on 2&ndash;4 September 2022 to discuss, enhance, and strengthen cooperation and collaboration for digital innovation and transformation that collectively support stronger world recovery. The G20 Digital Innovation Network (G20 DIN) was held as part of the Indonesian G20 Presidency and the Digital Economy Working Group,&nbsp; and was a continued legacy of the previous Group of Twenty (G20) Italian initiative called G20 Innovation League.</p>
<p>With the theme The Rise of Digital Economy: Post Pandemic Recovery and Beyond, the Indonesian G20 DIN aimed to &nbsp;showcase innovative solutions from start-ups amongst the G20 members and invitees from the healthtech, fintech, edtech, supply chain, and green and renewable energy sectors; share knowledge and insight on emerging innovations during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic recovery; and enhance public&ndash;private partnership by providing a platform and business opportunities and junctures to network and collaborate.</p>
<p>In his opening remarks, H.E. Johnny G. Plate, Indonesia&rsquo;s Minister of Communications and Informatics, emphasised the importance of digitally enabled business models and innovation that will continue to drive post-pandemic economic recovery and growth. He said a well-functioning digital economy can be maintained in the long run by building high-quality connectivity and partnership amongst global digital ecosystem players. On a similar note, H.E. Josephine Teo, Singapore&rsquo;s Minister of Communication and Information, pointed out that digital connectivity and cross-border data flow are keys to successful global digital innovation.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers in four-panel discussion sessions shared insights and lessons learnt from global tech companies and industry leaders from Google, Zoom, Grab, Alpha JWC Venture Accel, and Ajaib. In one session, Yossi Matias, Google&rsquo;s Vice President for Engineering and Research, noted that digital innovation, especially the use of artificial intelligence (AI), holds great potential and opportunities to solve some of the most pressing issues such as climate and sustainable environment crises as well as to redefine tech for good such as the use of AI in conversation/language and healthcare. Abhist Arora, Zoom&rsquo;s Head of Corporate Strategy, remarked that the pandemic has accelerated the movement of people towards digital platforms, with the future of work now being defined by flexibility and the ability to do remote or online work</p>
<p>The panel speakers tackled some concerns and shared forward-looking strategies on the future of the tech industry, global tech investment outlook, sustainable investments, and learning from Indonesia&rsquo;s early unicorns, against the backdrop of challenging pandemic times. With start-ups, corporates, and governments needing to navigate global uncertainties whilst preparing for future opportunities, the panel speakers agreed that building a good ecosystem for digital talents/professionals to flourish is critical to enabling more inclusive and innovative solutions. Markus Bracht, DEG&rsquo;s Vice President for Equity Asia, said that there is already a great need for investing in sustainable business and that more companies will need to consolidate and work together to accelerate growth and foster policy implementation and regulation to carry out environmental, social, and governance measures. Another key message was conveyed by Prashanth Prakash, Partner at Accel, who discussed the increasing interconnectedness of global problems as the risks for investors or start-ups that need to be managed effectively. Learning from Indonesia&rsquo;s emerging start-ups, some of the speakers proposed ways to weather the uncertainties that come with relearning and adjusting to different dynamics of market approach and global trends as well as to collaborate on building cooperation in cross-sector and nascent industries amongst institutions and ecosystem players. As Andrew Schoen, NEA Partner, stated: &lsquo;Tech is the institution and things will have to change&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The event held start-up pitching sessions on healthtech, edutech, supply chain, fintech, and renewable energy from selected start-ups amongst the G20 and invited countries. During the gala dinner, Mr Koji Hachiyama, ERIA&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer, reiterated the commitment of ASEAN and country partners to foster economic integration by collaborating and by enabling policy recommendations to support innovative solutions, including ERIA&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.esi-eria.org/">Entrepreneurship, Start-ups and Innovation (E-S-I) Knowledge Lab</a>, which aims to engage, empower, and connect ecosystem builders in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan, Director General of Informatics Application of Indonesia&rsquo;s Ministry of Communication and Informatics, delivered the closing remarks. At the awarding session for the start-up winners, Dr Giulia Ajmone Marsan, ERIA&rsquo;s Director of Strategy and Partnership, judge for the renewable energy, and Ms Lydia Ruddy, ERIA&rsquo;s Communication Director and judge for inclusive fintech topic, presented the awards. The event closed with a handover ceremony for the G20 India delegation.</p>
