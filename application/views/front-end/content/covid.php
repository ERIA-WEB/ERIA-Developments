                        Older
                        people are more vulnerable to the disease and more likely to need substantial care;
                        increased
                        exposure results in higher likelihood of infection; care-providers are on the front line
                        of
                        exposure -- often without the proper personal protective equipment; a strong immune
                        system is
                        key to minimising susceptibility; and women who are caring for others are often expected
                        to
                        maintain their usual roles and responsibilities which leads to long hours of work, sleep

                <p>ERIA's Director of Communications: In Indonesia, heart-breaking stories about healthcare
                    workers
                    who died as a result of Covid-19 started appearing in newspapers within weeks of the
                    first
                    diagnosed cases in the country. Doctors, nurses and other frontline health workers
                    without
                    appropriate protective equipment were falling gravely ill and in far too many cases,
                    dying.
                    Similar stories appeared across many Asean member states.</p>
